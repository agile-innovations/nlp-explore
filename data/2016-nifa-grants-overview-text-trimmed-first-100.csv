1007019,"Specialty crop growers rely on manual labor for fruit-picking, inspection, data collection for precision agriculture and similar labor-intensive tasks. It has been difficult to automate these tasks because specialty farms are much less structured environments when compared to commodity farms. However, there is a great need for automating specialty crop tasks because seasonal workers are costly and in short supply and collecting data for precision agriculture methods is difficult. Robotic systems capable of performing specialty crop tasks are becoming commercially available, more robust and affordable. What is missing are planning algorithms required for these robots to autonomously operate in complex environments such as apple orchards. The ultimate goal of the proposed work is to develop algorithms so that Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) robot systems can be used in automation tasks involving specialty crops.The project will focus on two sets of problems: (1) Surveying problems require planning the trajectory of a sensor to collect information about objects of interest. Such sensor planning problems in three-dimensional, complex environments are provably hard. The proposed work introduces new sensor planning problems in environments which are both general enough to capture the complexity of objects encountered on small farms (e.g., trees), and sufficiently constrained so that their visibility properties can be exploited to design efficient algorithms. (2) For end-effector placement, we introduce new visual servoing path planning techniques utilizing multiple arms for operation in cluttered environments with obstacles, such as the branches of a fruit tree.These algorithms will be implemented and tested in the context of two field studies involving quality inspection with near infra-red (NIR) sensors mounted on a COTS robotic manipulator and surveying to collect harvest related data. These studies, combined with the surveying and servoing algorithms, open possibilities for developing new metrics, tools and techniques for agricultural sciences by enabling data collection in scales not possible for humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007155,"Welfare status of animals used for food production remains a concern for consumers and producers. Physical characteristics used to assess welfare can include many different aspects of poultry. Footpad dermatitis (FPD or pododermatitis) is a necrotic condition that occurs on the bottom surface of the foot of poultry. Lesion prevalence, size and depth vary among poultry type. Lesions may be of such severity to be painful and so are considered a welfare issue in poultry production. Footpad dermatitis may also influence leg weakness development, another welfare indicator. Scoring systems exist for assessment of FPD but generally have not been linked to physical changes. The causes of FPD are numerous, however the interaction between the footpad of the bird with litter condition or characteristics appears to be key. The lesion in turkeys as compared to broiler chickens is of higher incidence and the time period of rearing to market for turkeys is so much longer than boiler chickens, so a greater potential exists for development of FPD and leg weakness in turkeys. Research is needed to understand the mechanisms of development of lesions in order to lead to more effective mitigation strategies.The proposed research will first use a survey approach to determine if differences in FPD incidence and severity exist among different turkey sites and can be correlated to existing litter condition and characteristics. The assessments of FPD and gait score will use various published methods. Samples of litter will be collected and analyzed. Samples of tissue, bone and intestinal contents will be collected from euthanized birds with different scores of FPD and examined for differences in foot pad pathology, leg weakness, immune response indicators and bacterial composition. Walking characteristics of the turkeys will be measured with a gait pad. The second approach utilizes a controlled research study to change litter characteristics by changing stocking density and bedding material in the rearing of turkey hens. Similar measurements will be taken as in the survey approach. Relationships between the assessments and measurements will be determined for level of correlation. The overall goal of the project is to improve assessment methods for FPD and to identify factors in the development of foot pad that can be modified to mitigate the incidence and severity of FPD. The expected impacts of the research would be beneficial to the turkey industry - producers and processors; and consumers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007216,"The rationale for the project lies in these facts: 1) Irrigated agriculture produces more than 40% of agricultural products on &lt;20% of agricultural land in the nation, producing $67 billion in farm gate receipts, but uses approximately 60% of national freshwater resources, a significant portion of which is lost due to poor irrigation scheduling while unintentionally moving nutrients into streams and lakes; 2) There are &gt;$400 million savings in water, energy and fertilizer that remain unclaimed due to the failure of ET based and soil water sensor based agricultural irrigation scheduling to gain wide adoption and the relative lack of precision of those methods when used alone; 3) The proven ability of sensor-feedback-based irrigation control systems to optimize irrigation applications and water use efficiency; 4) The fact that &gt;70% of American irrigation systems are now pressurized (NASS, 2014) and thus are amenable to sensor-feedback control; 5) The fact that the major manufacturers of pressurized irrigation systems, both center pivot and linear move, offer variable rate irrigation (VRI) systems, and the major manufacturers of drip irrigation systems offer zone control; and 6) The fact that despite the availability of VRI and drip irrigation systems amenable to control, there is a nearly complete lack of commercial technology for writing VRI or zone control prescriptions that respond day to day to actual crop water needs and that allow site-specific optimization of water and nutrient use efficiency while stabilizing yields.This project directly addresses the need for efficient water and nutrient use in irrigation agriculture by developing new wireless sensor technology, integrating wireless sensor networks for plant and soil water status with wireless weather data acquisition into a user-friendly system for irrigation control and management, and developing new algorithms for control through software/firmware engineering. And, it specifically addresses the national needs to protect and sustain local and global food supply and security, and the sustainable use of natural resources. The project addresses the need to improve the efficiency of energy and water use by enabling engineering, computing and information systems for plant production, while refining the sustainability of agricultural systems. And, it addresses three primary challenges: Keeping American agriculture competitive while ending world hunger; Adapting agriculture to climate variability and change and mitigating their effects; and Solving critical water resource problems in rural and agricultural watersheds across the United States.The advanced sensors and irrigation control system will be applicable to most of the pressurized agricultural irrigation systems in the nation, which makes it applicable to &gt;37 million acres of irrigated land. The project is directly aimed at developing and enabling engineering, computing and information systems for natural resource conservation and plant production, by improving efficiency of energy and water use. Success will refine the sustainability of agricultural systems and improve economic, environmental and social outcomes in water limited regions.Potential savings in pumping and fertilizer costs exceed $400 million annually due to the improvements in WUE that come with sensor-based SCADA irrigation management. When yield stabilization and improvements are added, the total improvement in farm income exceeds $1 billion. The absence of VRI prescription decision support systems in the market will be addressed by introduction of a sensor-based system for prescription generation that is made robust by combined plant, soil and weather sensing in a feed-back and mutually self-correcting system. This and the new sensors that will be developed will be manufactured and sold by at least three companies and will be completely novel in the marketplace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007447,"This research project outlines an engineering plan to improve the detection capabilities of a nondestructive system to measure and map soil carbon stores as a result of land use practices. An Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) system has been demonstrated to measure multiple elements in the field over large volumes of soil compared with competing techniques. INS is a gamma-ray spectroscopic technique that can detect multiple elements simultaneously. In this effort, we will focus on improving the detection capabilities of the system and adding on-board GPS capabilities to the system. Additional gamma-ray detectors will be added to increase the counting rate which will improve the minimum detection limit, minimum detection change and sensitivity of the system. GPS capabilities will be integrated into the INS platform and merged with the INS spectrum. Soil carbon content will be used to characterize the performance gains that are achieved through these engineering changes. The modified system will be field test on three different land use cases: pasture, row crop, and forest. The results of this effort will enable the generation of high resolution maps of soil total carbon stores with greater spatial and temporal resolution than is currently economically feasible.

1007484,"Many segments of the forest products industry are in mature life cycle phases, are greatly dependent on the housing market, and are stagnant in terms of expansion and new market development. Development and investment in value-added specialties and novel manufacturing processes that cater to niche markets with high profit margins can help boost the industry and foster positive growth. There is a need to develop a sustainable manufacturing process (a process that is eco-friendly and could be established as a small-scale facility or be integrated into an existing operation, which is economically viable, reaches new markets, and promotes rural economic development) to mitigate environmental and social impacts of current practices, including resource exploitation, forest fires, climate change, and rural employment opportunities. Liquid molding technology, commonly used for synthetic fibers, provides an opportunity to develop a sustainable manufacturing infrastructure. Properly developed, it has the potential to convert underutilized lignocellulosic fiber from forest thinning for hazardous fuel reduction and fast growing short-rotation plantations into composite products of complex geometries for niche markets such as the automotive, marine, and aviation industry.Resin transfer molding (RTM) and vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) are widely applied in manufacturing airplane and automobile interior composite products due to their cost-effectiveness. Today&#39;s automobile industry is under considerable pressure from societal and environmental concerns due to the relatively low fuel efficiency and disposal problems of synthetic fibers. Auto body and interiors are of 40% of the total vehicle weight, which indicates a promising way of improving the fuel efficiency. Developing lightweight materials for interiors provides a promising opportunity to improve fuel efficiency. However, lightweight materials like carbon fibers are expensive as compared to steel, urging the application of lower cost lightweight materials. Natural fiber (as a lower cost, renewable with low specific gravity and high specific strength and stiffness) has shown potential in automobile non-load-bearing component parts, such as door panels, seat backs and interior parts by European car manufactures. Wood strand composites have been used for decades as a cost effective replacement for solid structural lumber. Wood strand (as a cost-effective natural fiber) can be easily be formed and molded into automobile components as a panel with complex geometry and good surface finish using the RTM technology. Recent work has shown that wood strand composites can be formed into thin, geometrically complex panels. Liquid molding of wood strand composites may further improve this material form with improved surface finish and part stability. Preliminary forming studies of wood strand composites using compression molding and resin transfer molding suggests they could replace polymers in many applications due to their low cost, high specific strength and stiffness. Technological challenges such as preform fabrication, the influence of strand geometry on complex shapes, manufacturing methods for high production rates and material performance are needed for acceptance of this material form in the automotive industry.The objectives of the proposed study are to apply and develop the underpinning scientific principles of liquid molding technology, widely used with synthetic fibers, to produce wood strand composite panels for automotive interior parts. In the proposed work, compression resin transfer molding and vacuum assisted resin transfer molding will be investigated to understand the fundamentals of liquid molding large curvature and high-performance wood strand composite products for potential applications in the automotive industry. Meeting these objectives will identify the limits of mold shape, optimal locations and quantity of inlet and outlet resin ports, and resin viscosity requirements for automotive cure times and production rates. Benchmark properties of 3D wood strand panels produced using liquid molding will be established. A prototype automotive interior will validate the use of liquid molding as a viable technology to produce automotive composite panels product using wood strands. The positive impact of the outcomes of the proposed work is the development of an economically viable strategy, within the framework of a sustainable lignocellulosic fiber-based infrastructure in different regions of our country, for production of composite panels for new markets, such as the automotive and aerospace industries that demand high-performance and durable products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous evidences exist for promoting increased consumption of brown rice and dry beans for chronic disease prevention , yet prospective evaluation of health outcomes remains difficult due to lack of reliable dietary intake biomarkers. Our completed, short-term feeding studies with fixed amounts of rice bran and navy beans in children with elevated cholesterol and adult colorectal cancer survivors provide a novel opportunity for assessing dietary biomarkers of intake. Rice and beans merit biomarkers for nutritional assessment without reliance on self-reported intakes for whole grains and legumes during nutrition assessments as wheat, barley, rye and soybeans have been studied in dietary patterns and for relationships with disease risk. A major challenge with validating dietary biomarkers is that an elevated level of consumption is often required for reliable quantification, and emerging evidence supports that the overall dietary pattern (e.g. vegetarian, omnivore) can influence the profile of metabolites detected. The identification and validation of dietary biomarkers using metabolomics is an emerging field of investigation with broad-spectrum applications of health importance, and is the major focus of the research strategy for developing rice bran and navy bean biomarkers in children and adults herein.

The overall goal of this project is to identify and characterize bacterial determinants, fruit attributes and processing factors that collectively lead to the infiltration and transfer of S. enterica and L. monocytogenes into different types of fresh and fresh-cut fruits linked to recent foodborne disease outbreaks. Combined microscopic, microbiological, molecular and genomic approaches will be used to study the physical and molecular mechanisms used by S. enterica and L. monocytogenes outbreak strains to internalize apple, cantaloupe, tomato, and cucumber during hydrocooling and cutting that are most relevant to postharvest industry processing and retail practices and likely lead to pathogen internalization. Results from this project will fill important knowledge gaps regarding the routes and patterns of pathogen internalization, as well as the fate of the internalized pathogens in fresh and fresh-cut fruits.

These ammonia emissions have important impacts on air quality and ecosystems downwind of the sources. Ammonia may contribute to airborne fine particulate matter, which can adversely affect health, visibility and climate, while deposition of ammonia and ammonium to soils can change plant growth charateristics.The proposed project will use laser sensors deployed on small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) to measure ammonia and methane emissions from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and to quantify ammonia deposition downwind of CAFOs. Key innovations of the emissions monitoring system include: 1) simultaneous ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) detection using open-path cavity ring-own spectroscopy, 2) sUAS flight capabilities that are more nimble, safer and more cost effective to operate than manned aircraft, and 3) inversion and flux modeling to infer sources, fluxes, and ammonia deposition. In addition to providing an improved means to quantify amonia emissions and deposition, we will seek to identify new best practices to mitigate their negative effects, for example, planting crops downwind of sites to increase local ammonia deposition and reduce deposition at further locations. The methane measurements will provide source fluxes to quantify the carbon footprint of CAFOs. More broadly, the project will also demonstrate the possibility of certifying and flying sUAS at agricultural sites which can also be useful for crop, soil, and canopy imaging, as well as animal health monitoring and other applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1007559,"The use of reclaimed water and biosolids in agriculture has increased drastically due to worsening water scarcity and rising need for waste disposal. Reuse of such previously under-utilized resources has important economic and environmental benefits, but also poses unknown risks to consumers due to the potential introduction of many contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) into food products. The perceived risks are the greatest for fresh produce such as vegetables and fruits that are often consumed raw. However, the occurrence and levels of CECs in vegetables and fruits under field conditions are essentially unknown, preventing assessment of the associated food safety. This project aims to improve food safety by evaluating emerging and under-researched chemical hazards in fresh produce. Specifically, we will first conduct greenhouse and cell-based experiments to develop a short list of CECs that have a high tendency for plant accumulation, and then measure the actual levels of these priority CECs in edible parts of common vegetables (lettuce, spinach, cabbage, celery, tomato, pepper, cucumber, radish, carrot, onions) and fruits (strawberries, melons, apple, citrus, avocado, plum) grown with treated wastewater irrigation or biosolid amendment in fields in Southern California. We will further use typical consumption values to estimate dietary intakes of CECs for different age groups and predict potential human exposure risks.

1007566,"Oats are considered to be one of the healthiest cereal food and the consumer demand for oats and oat-based products have steadily increased over the years. This trend may be desirable in promoting public health. However, recent surveys conducted in the United States have found high levels and incidences of ochratoxin A (OTA), a possible human carcinogen, in oat-based cereal products particularly in infant cereals. Several toxigenic fungi in the genus Aspergillus and Penicillium are known to contaminate agricultural crops and produce OTA. This potent mycotoxin has been regulated in other countries but no regulation or guideline for OTA in foods has been set in the United States. Most of the infant cereals are processed by using either indirect- or direct-steam heating, or extrusion cooking processes. Although processing could help reduce OTA, knowledge about the chemical transformation and residual toxicity of OTA in infant cereals as affected by commonly-used processing technologies has not been established. We propose to investigate the fate of OTA during the processing of oats using chemical analysis and toxicological evaluation of OTA and the degradation products formed. The proposed research will provide important data on the threat of OTA contamination in oat-based infant cereals and effective control strategies.

1007600,"The global use of N fertilizers has been increasing to meet increasing demands for higher crop outputs. This creates tremendous burdens economically and environmentally because of energy costs of industrial N fixation, pollution, and eutrophication. There are intensive efforts and desire to develop crop plants that utilize N more efficiently. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the essential steps in plant uptake, transport, and assimilation of N. However, much less is known about signaling and regulatory events that modulate plant N utilization. A better understanding of the modulation can be applied towards designing crop plants that sense and utilize N more effectively. This project focuses on whether and how membrane lipids and associated enzymes modulate plant N utilization.The project will use soybean to determine the function of a specific group of phospholipase, PLD, providing opportunities to integrate basic knowledge with potential applications to increase crop production and quality. In addition, legume N2 fixation is the most important N source in agro-ecosystems. Thus, developing legume varieties with effective N2 fixation could have profound significance in improving agricultural sustainability. The project employs molecular, biochemical, cellular and whole-plant approaches towards improving N uptake, assimilation, accumulation, and/or utilization through studies in soybean and studies of plant-microbe interactions. It tests the hypotheses that PLD activity and membrane lipids modulate the nutrient-recycling, autophagic processes and plant N use efficiency. Potential conceptual breakthroughs from the study include revealing new mechanisms of regulation of autophagy, N remobilization, and N use efficiency. Also the study of soybean may offer an opportunity to determine how the lipid regulation of autophagy and N utilization impacts the tolerance of nodulation to soil N levels. An increased tolerance would allow increased N2 fixation in soils with a high residual level of N. Finally, manipulations of lipid regulated processes may lead to increased growth and seed production under N-limited conditions. Therefore, the proposed study addresses the program area: Plant Health and Production and Plant Products, particularly regarding the priority areas of Photosynthesis and Nutrient Use in Agricultural Plants (A1151).

We will address this need through conduct of controlled intervention trials to test effectiveness of the existing ultraviolet and a novel sulfuric acid fertilizer based treatments of surface water for irrigation in reducing contamination of spinach and cantaloupes at harvest.

With this in mind, much attention has been given to diagnostics, immunology, epidemiology and surveillance for pathogens such as Porcine Endemic Diarrhea (PED) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) viruses. However, surprisingly little is known about how viruses and other pathogens antagonize efficiency of growth in pigs. In particular, the latest edition of the Nutrient Requirements of Swine guidelines states that more information and research is needed to address how health impacts nutrient (i.e. amino acids) utilization and requirements for growingswine. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve delivery and availability of nutrients and energy to immunologically challenged pigs in order to obtain higher efficiency of lean tissue production and wellbeing. Achieving this goal will reduce production and efficiency losses due to disease challenges. This proposal also strengthens collaboration efforts of a strong research group focused on understanding and improving efficient meat animal production.Using two very common swine enteric and respiratory pathogens (PEDV and PRRSV, respectively), the proposed experiments will also adopt classical amino acid digestibility approaches to address industry and National Research Council nutrient requirement knowledge gaps for health challenged pigs.

1007688,"Heat Stress decreases the profitability of U.S. animal agriculture by approximately $2.4 billion/year. Strategies to limit the production losses associated with heat exposureare largely limited to intensive production systems and highly dependent on water and electricity. With the increased pressure on water supplies throughout the western United States it is essential to find water and energy independent alternatives to limit production losses to heat stress. This grant focuses on the hypothesis that the increased histamine synthesis that accompanies heat stress depresses food intake, milk production, and mammary development. 3 specific aims have been designed to identify pharmacological targets to mitigate production losses common to heat exposure. In objective 1,we aim to identify the histamine signaling pathway that depresses food intake during heat stress. In objective 2, we aim toindentify the histamine signaling pathway that decreases milk production during heat stress. In objective 3, we aim to isolate the signals that mute mammary development during heat stress. We expect that these studies will identify pharmacological targets to prevent the decreased food intake and milk production during heat stress. Accordingly, we believe that a pharmacological treatment arising from this research couldimprove profitability of U.S. animal agriculture while simultaneously limiting the need for energy and water intensive cooling strategies that are currently employed to maintain animal production when temperatures rise.

1007693,"Subclinical hypocalcemia affects 50% of all dairy cows in the United States. Cows that succumb to subclinical hypocalcemia are more likely to develop other metabolic disorders and diseases that are common in early lactation dairy cows. The overall objective of the project aims to describe the contribution of serotonin to the regulation of calcium homeostasis in lactating dairy cows. We will use in vitro laboratory techniques combined with cow experiments to demonstrate that serotonin controls maternal calcium concentrations by regulating calcium transport and parathyroid hormone-related protein production in the mammary gland. Parathyroid hormone-related protein production is critical for calcium mobilization from bone. Serotonin has been shown to coordinate calcium transport and signaling in the mammary gland and is critical to regulating the communication between the bone and mammary gland during lactation. Therefore, dissecting the mechanisms by which serotonin regulates maternal calcium homeostasis will lead us to develop novel methods to prevent hypocalcemia. Current methods for the prevention of hypocalcemia in dairy cows are insufficient. Our project aims to improve the productivity and health of the dairy cow by reducing hypocalcemia during the periparturient period. The overall impact of our research aims to result in a novel method to improve maternal calcium homeostasis during the early lactation period through manipulation of the serotonin-calcium-parathyroid hormone related-protein axis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007696,"Blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum) is among the berries with high polyphenol contents. Since blackcurrant farming started in the U.S. in 2003, it has gained popularity due to its potential health benefits. Our preliminary studies suggest that blackcurrant prevents adipose inflammation and hyperglycemia, enhances the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis/bioenergetics, and decreases the inflammatory action of splenic monocytes in diet-induced obesity mice. Based on these findings, in this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that blackcurrant enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and energy utilization in the skeletal muscle and prevents monocyte phenotypic switch from anti-inflammatory M2 to pro-inflammatory M1 type in bone marrow and spleen. This, in turn, prevents fat and reactive oxygen species accumulation and inhibits recruitment of M1 macrophages in adipose and skeletal muscle, ultimately inhibiting obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance (IR). The proposed research will employ a combination of cell and animal experiments to systematically determine the bioactivity of blackcurrant as related to the prevention of inflammation and IR in obesity focusing on mitochondrial functions and monocytes/macrophage phenotypic switch. By examining the potential interplay of macrophages and mitochondria in triggering inflammation and IR, the proposed study will allow us to gain novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of blackcurrant against inflammation and metabolic dysfunctions associated with obesity. Results from this work will be directly applicable to U. S. agriculture. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007700,"Producers of fresh fruits and vegetables need practical and sustainable methods to minimize the survival and persistence of human pathogens, such Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes in soil. Soil contamination with these human pathogens represents a major problem for the fresh produce supply chain because of the lack of valid remediation strategies that growers could implement to reduce and/or eliminate the presence of naturally occurring human pathogens. Soil contamination with Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes across major production regions within the U.S has resulted in numerous acres of abandoned crops including leafy greens and melons. Destruction of multiple fields or contaminated crops due to human pathogen contamination has initiated a decline in the economy of many states not only due to the loss of high cash crops but also to increased environmental damage owed mainly to the use of non-sustainable practices.Our research will focus on three main objectives: 1- studying the prevalence of Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes on farm land used for leafy green and melon production that utilize uncomposted manure following the 90 to 120day rule for organic productions. 2- We will use this information to develop challenge studies where the persistence of Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes will be assessed after the application of three intervention strategies: - cover cropping, 2- solarization and 3- the incorporation of grape pomace and mushroom compost to soil mesocosms. These first two objectives are fundamental to understand the mechanisms determining pathogen die-off in soils and therefore increase our ability to formulate effective and sustainable preharvest interventions necessary to sustain fresh produce supply across the U.S. 3- Identify and quantify the costs to farmers required to implement and maintain the recommended mitigation practices within their cropping system. . This last objective will allow us to establish the potential long term economic impact of these new remediation practices on farmer&#39;s income and how this new economic expense compares with land abandonment and loss in productivity.Combining this research approach with tangible economic metrics will allow us to provide growers with science-based tools that could salvage their economic livelihood.

1007708,"Epidemiological and pre-clinical data support that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) reduce colon cancer risks. However, after decades of research, the effects of omega-3 PUFAs remain controversial, making it difficult to make dietary recommendations of omega-3 PUFAs for cancer prevention. Therefore, it is of critical importance to better understand the mechanisms behind the anti-cancer activity of omega-3 PUFAs to optimize their use and benefit in a larger population.Here in this proposal we will investigate the mechanisms by which omega-3 PUFAs inhibit colon cancer. We will test the hypothesis that omega-3 PUFAs suppress colon cancer progression in part via induction of anti-tumor immune responses and changes in the colon lipid composition. Our preliminary data showed that dietary supplementation of high-purity omega-3 PUFAs dramatically increased anti-tumor immune cells in tumor tissues. Here we will extend our discovery to investigate the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on colon cancer and associated inflammation and immune responses. Using a unique LC-MS/MS lipidomics platform, our preliminary data also showed that lipid metabolites in both the blood and tumor are profoundly altered by the omega-3 vs. omega-6 diets. In this proposal we will use LC-MS/MS to determine the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on profiles of lipid metabolites in tissues, and use transgenic animal models to elucidate the specific pathways and metabolites involved in the effects of omega-3 PUFAs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007710,"Texture is a major driver of consumer food preferences. Mechanical and friction behaviors, measured using rheological and tribological techniques, respectively, play a primary role in many textural attributes. A fundamental understanding of rheological (flow and deformation) and tribological (friction) behaviors is a key component in designing food products with appealing textures. Fundamental rheological and tribological behaviors include viscosity, viscoelastic, large-strain, and friction behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to support and increase fundamental rheological and tribological research of food products in the Food Rheology Laboratory at the University of Idaho by purchase of a DHR-2 Rheometer. The Food Rheology laboratory is currently equipped with two rheometers: a DHR-3 Rheometer and an AR-2000 rheometer. However, the AR-2000 is not functioning and the manufacturer no longer supports repair. The rheometers are key research instruments in the Food Rheology Laboratory and are used by students and faculty in the Food Science and Biosystems Engineering Departments at both the University of Idaho and Washington State University. Having only one functioning rheometer has resulted in a bottleneck for sample evaluation, and significantly slowed progress of rheological/tribological research. This bottleneck will worsen as the number of rheometer users increases. Purchase of a DHR-2 rheometer would alleviate this bottleneck, increasing research productivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007711,"Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2010) and the new Scientific Report of the Dietary Guidelines committee (2015) both recommend that consumers increase consumption of polyunsaturated fats and decrease consumption of saturated fats to decrease risk for coronary heart disease. Low moisture foods are a large contributor of saturated fat in the American diet. For instance, grain-based desserts and snacks, including many low-moisture foods like crackers, cookies, and granola bars, are among the top three contributors of saturated fat to the American diet (National Cancer Institute, 2010). The association of high dietary saturated fat with consumption of low moisture foods suggests that improving the nutritional profiles of these products by substituting their saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fatty acids could have an important, positive impact on consumer health. However, such reformulations are challenging because fats high in saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and these solid fats play an important role in texture of low moisture foods. In addition, increasing polyunsaturated fatty acid composition in low moisture foods leads to an increase rancidity, which will negatively impact product quality, nutritional composition, and shelf-life.This project will determine how different ingredients in low moisture foods impact the development of rancidity. With this knowledge, technologies will be developed to help prevent rancidity which will allow for more unsaturated fats to be used in these projects thus making the foods healthier. In addition, these technologies will decrease food waste thus improving sustainability. This is important since over 40% of the foods produced on the farm become spoiled costing Americans over $180 billion in food/year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007724," Manufactured nanomaterials are being used in a variety of consumer products including sunscreens, cosmetics, personal-care products, and paints. Nanomaterials are extremely small compounds having at least one dimension less than 100 nanometers. For comparison, one typical hair from a human head or a single sheet of paper has a thickness of approximately 100,000 nanometers. These tiny particles are smaller than the cells of a human body and, in fact, smaller than the nucleus inside of those cells. With an increasing presence in household goods, the demand for and the production of nanomaterials composed of carbon, metal oxides, polystyrene and silica has also increased. For example, to fill product needs the world-wide production of titanium-dioxide nanoparticles is projected to exceed 200,000 tons/year by 2016. As the production of nanomaterials increases, so too does the likelihood of release into the environment as a result of spills, use of products, post-consumer degradation of material, leaching from septic tanks and landfills, or outflow from wastewater treatment facilities. Many questions regarding the environmental safety of nanomaterials have been raised. Toxicological effects of nanoparticles in humans are well studied and include inflammation, oxidative stress and DNA damage. Even particles made of low-toxicity material (e.g., polystyrene) can be harmful when delivered in their nano form, presumably due to their high surface area. Comparatively little research has focused on the effects of nanomaterials on marine ecosystems, or whether this class of emerging pollutants could be transferred through marine food webs to humans. Coastal ecosystems near densely populated, industrialized regions are particularly vulnerable to the infiltration of man-made materials such as nanoparticles. Filter-feeding bivalves, such as clams, mussels and oysters, which are harvested or cultured for human consumption, are particularly susceptible to nanoparticle exposure given their abundance in coastal waters and their particle feeding behavior. Few studies, however, have addressed how these animals encounter nanoparticles in the environment and little is known about the accumulation and elimination of nanoparticles by bivalves. In this project, we will investigate whether nanoparticles could be a foodborne hazard in shellfish. Specifically, we will study: 1) the way in which bivalves encounter and ingest nanoparticles; 2) whether they accumulate nanoparticles during chronic exposure; and 3) if bivalves can eliminate the nanoparticles from their body after exposure ceases, and if so how long does it take. Results will provide realistic estimates of exposure and bioaccumulation of nanoparticles in shellfish, and help elucidate the potential for nanoparticles to be passed to higher trophic levels including humans. Ultimately, new knowledge generated by our research will inform decision makers, and guide strategies for the management of this class of emerging pollutants, and help ensure and improve shellfish safety. Through outreach and dissemination activities, we will educate and deliver science-based knowledge to scientists, shellfish growers, managers, and the general public in order to inform decision making. Such actions will serve to enhance the environmental quality of coastal ecosystems and help protect the living marine resources on which aquaculture and fisheries rely. Protecting fish and shellfish resources is important for both long-range improvement and sustainability of the aquaculture and fisheries industries. Determining the extent to which nanoparticles are an emerging food safety issue is also critical for ensuring the quality and safety of seafood collected by recreational activities. Such activities have been shown to enhance human health and the well-being of society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1007737,"Inflammation promotes all steps of gastrointestinal cancer. Blocking inflammation through diet is a cost effective strategy to prevent early-stage carcinogenesis. For a long time, dietary polyphenols&#39; health properties were attributed to their antioxidant effects as free radical scavengers. However, a direct antioxidant activity of these compounds is very unlikely due to their low tissue concentrations. The new paradigm articulates that dietary polyphenols modulate cell signaling, interact with transcription factors, and consequently regulate gene expression. It would be through these mechanisms that curcumin, the principal polyphenol of turmeric, alleviates inflammation. Even when observed in vivo, polyphenols&#39; bioactivity may be one-or-two orders of magnitude lower than in vitro. The main reason and limitation remain the low bioavailability of most polyphenols. To achieve sufficient concentrations at their site(s) of action, consumed polyphenols must overcome multiple barriers, chief among them, the intestinal wall. Evidence indicates that piperine, one of the major components of black pepper, enhances the intestinal bioavailability of polyphenols; however, it is not yet known whether this approach promotes gastrointestinal health. A combination of cell culture assays and transgenic mouse studies will be employed to pursue the following objectives: 1) to determine whether curcumin + piperine synergize in the prevention of gut inflammation and carcinogenesis, and 2) to elucidate the mechanisms by which curcumin + piperine protect against intestinal inflammation in relation to the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a protein kinase involved in inflammation and carcinogenesis.This project will improve nutrition and health by addressing novel relationships between dietary polyphenols in foods and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, by generating key biomarker profiles for comparison with human data, and by comparing regulatory pathways in vitro and in vivo. The U.S. agriculture and food systems will benefit from our research as we anticipate that the knowledge generated by this project will help guide the development of food systems that valorize the combination of phenolics from different plant sources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To accomplish our goals we propose the following supporting objectives, to be conducted in well-established mouse models:Determine the extent to which obesity-promoted colorectal tumorigenesis is inhibited by the combination of vitamin B6 and curcumin, and define an optimally effective tumor-suppressive dose of this combination regimen.Delineate the relative chemopreventive potencies of vitamin B6 and curcumin as individual agents, and compare the extent to which combining the two offers multiplicative protection against tumorigenesis.Examine whether packaging the B6 and curcumin in a novel colon-targeting nanoparticle system potentiates the tumor-suppressive properties of the combination regimen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007741,"Aronia berries are rich in polyphenols and an important emerging crop in North America for health. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggest that dietary aronia berries can mitigate inflammation associated with chronic disease. Our central hypothesis for this project is that aronia berry consumption inhibits the initiation of intestinal inflammation by dampening proinflammatory Th17 cells through affecting Treg and cellular antioxidant function. To test this hypothesis we will pursue experiments to 1) identify the colonic T cell populations most affected by aronia consumption during initiation and early progression of colitis, 2) identify the mechanism and function of anti-inflammatory colonic interleukin-10 in the anti-colitic activity of aronia berry consumption, and 3) establish which lymphocyte antioxidants are modulated by aronia consumption and prevent intestinal inflammation. Experiments will utilize mouse models relevant to human development of chronic intestinal inflammation. Successful completion of this research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the anti-inflammatory potential of aronia consumption and provide information about their mechanism(s) of inhibiting the onset of intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, this work is expected to lead to new knowledge about how diets can affect the function of T cells.

Since nutrition represents an important factor affecting the intestinal environment, dietary incorporation of functional foods that prevent inflammation is a logical approach. Although few studies have demonstrated the anti-IBD properties of yogurt, there is scant information on the application of cheese in preventing inflammation. The increased consumption of cheese over yogurt, its versatility and presence of diverse bioactive components, make cheese an ideal dietary therapy for IBD. The therapeutic benefits of cheese are attributed to presence of starter lactic acid bacteria (SLAB), non-starter cultures (NSLAB) and other bioactive components. While some studies have investigated the functional role of NSLAB, anti-inflammatory effects of cheese and SLAB have not been examined. Additionally, use of NSLAB is associated with strain disparities and inconsistencies in the observed protective effects. Unlike NSLAB, SLAB are highly characterized, commercial cultures that offer consistency in their functional attributes. Therefore, this study will investigate the role of cheese and SLAB in preventing inflammation in vivo. Additionally, we will elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of SLAB and cheese mediated protective action using genome-wide transcriptome analysis. Ultimately, completion of this research will provide a cheese-based adjunct dietary therapy for prevention of IBD.

Salmonellosis and listeriosis outbreaks have not yet been attributed to produce contaminated at grocery retail likely due to the fact that risk of contamination at retail is essentially unknown and would likely result in sporadic cases. We hypothesize that retail produce storage, processing, and sales environments are potential niches for Salmonella, L. monocytogenes and L. spp and transmission to produce at retail is a significant public health risk, which could be reduced by targeted control strategies. We propose to (i) elucidate Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and other L. spp. contamination patterns and persistence in retail grocery, (ii) identify practices and store characteristics that differentiate high and low prevalence, and (iii) develop and test practical, feasible control strategies to reduce contamination and cross-contamination in retail produce environments.

1007750,"Growing food crops in protected environment like high tunnels is becoming increasingly popular across the country, especially in the Midwest. Although high tunnel production has several advantages with regard to crop growth, it can modify the light characteristics in a way that can adversely affect the crop nutritive and health-promoting characteristics. Typical poly covers used in high tunnel and low tunnel production can alter light characteristics to reduce the production of many bioactive and health-promoting phytochemicals. Therefore, one of the primary goals of this project is to gain an understanding of the role of light factors (intensity and spectral characteristics) on nutritive and health-promoting qualities of lettuce and tomato in high tunnel production, and develop light management tools for both pre- and post harvest stages to improve/maintain high nutritive qualities in these crops. We will investigate the complex role of light factors on the production and accumulation of these phytochemicals in growth chamber and greenhouse studies. Following this, a three-year field trail will be conducted using high tunnels with photoselective covers to develop appropriate strategies to enhance the quality of these crops. Similarly, optimal light factors and practical methods will be identified by using the emerging LED (light emitting diode) technology during postharvest storage to maintain/improve the nutritional attributes of the harvested crops.

1007755,"Consumption of diets rich in fruits and vegetables reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (e.g., atherosclerosis). Some of the health benefits associated with these dietary components are derived from pigments present in plants called flavonoids. However, our bodies do not absorb most flavonoids as they are present in the plants. Flavonoids are metabolined by the trillions of microbes that inhabit our gut (i.e., gut microbiota). Gut microbes contribute to the beneficial effects of flavonoids by transforming them into more readily absorbable and active metabolites. However, there is a large degree of interpersonal variation in the observed benefits and, evidently, in the nature and extent of these microbial transformations, which remain poorly characterized. Thus, we cannot currently predict the extent to which--if at all--an individual will benefit from the consumption of flavonoids. This proposal describes an approach for determining the relationship between interpersonal differences in gut microbial transformations of flavonoids and the beneficial effects associated with their consumption. We will investigate how interpersonal variation in gut microbiota composition affects the protective effects of a specific group of flavonoids. We will transplant human gut microbial communities (i.e., human feces) from healthy subjects and subjects with cardiovascular disease into groups of otherwise identical germ-free mice (i.e., mice that are not colonized with any microbes), and test for causal associations between gut microbial community composition, flavonoid transformations and development of atherosclerosis. Collectively, these studies will provide key insights into the roles of gut microbes in mediating effects associated consumption of flavonoids.

Despite widespread use for almost 40 years, and demonstrated efficacy of ionophores in increasing the efficiency of ruminant production, their cellular and molecular mode of action remains largely unknown and without a genomic or genetic foundation. Ionophore use is coming under increased scrutiny following the new initiative to phase out the use of growth promoting antibiotics in animal diets. The current proposal, to study the cellular and molecular basis of the mode of action of monensin in rumen bacteria, seeks to capitalize on the availability of genome sequence for representative strains of rumen bacteria as well as next generation sequencing technologies that accelerate our ability to study genetic regulation in bacteria and generate new knowledge concerning mode of action at the transcriptional level.To achieve the goal of unraveling the complex cellular and molecular mode of action of monensin in rumen bacteria, we propose to use Next Generation Sequencing of the transcriptome, also known as RNA-Seq, that enables detection of the full transcript repertoire at an unprecedented scale. We intend to follow a set of sequential specific objectives to compare transcriptomes, bioenergetic fluxes and metabolites of cells grown in the presence and absence of monensin. We expect that our approach will reveal, for the first time, the identity of genetic regulatory circuits that account for susceptibility (sensitivity), adaptation and tolerance (intrinsic resistance) demonstrated by these functionally and numerically important ruminal bacterial species. Advances in our understanding of the cellular and molecular mode of action of monensin in ruminal bacteria should ultimately result in knowledge that will prolong the efficacy of ionophore antibiotics and lead to the discovery of the next generation of compounds with similar modes of action.

1007776,"As the world&#39;s population increases, there is a need to increase production efficiency and quantity of protein sources, including meat. Poor maternal nutrition (over- and restricted feeding) reduces muscle mass, alters muscle metabolism, and decreases expression of the myogenic regulatory factors (MRF) that control muscle development in the offspring, decreasing production efficiency and diminishing animal health. Insults to muscle progenitor cells (MPC) during fetal development likely contribute to both immediate and long-term negative outcomes. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that poor maternal nutrition (over- and restricted feeding) will negatively affect MPC in the offspring by 1) altering expression of MRFs and differentiation of MPC into myotubes, and 2) altering muscle cell metabolism. The specific objectives are to determine in offspring of poorly nourished ewes 1) the temporal expression of Pax7 and MRFs as MPC progress through myogenesis, 2) the ability of MPC to form myotubes, and 3) changes in MPC metabolism during development. Based on preliminary data, we expect that MPC from offspring of poorly nourished ewes will exhibit altered expression of MRFs, resulting in precocious differentiation. Metabolism in these MPC is expected to be more glycolytic and less oxidative, contributing to reduced feed efficiency in the postnatal animal.

Evidence indicates that AOPPs play a crucial role in aging-associated bone loss and suggests that the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods may lower the risk of aging-associated osteoporosis by reducing AOPPs. Our preliminary studies with cell and animal models have shown that blackcurrant or its anthocyanin-rich extract is effective in reducing bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. However, the animal model used might not adequately mimic the conditions of aging-associated bone loss coupled with menopause that exist in middle-aged and older women. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of antioxidants on the formation of AOPPs in vivo still remain unknown.

1007788,"The ProblemAbout one-third of the U.S. dairy herd valued at ($5.4B) is replaced yearly. These replacement animals come from the female calves born to lactating cows on these farms. It has become widely appreciated that nutrition and management of animals in early life can dramatically affect future performance, longevity, and well-being of these animals. We recently confirmed that pre-weaning calf nutrition can dramatically affect growth and development of the mammary gland and especially the quantity of epithelial tissue in the developing gland. Because these rudimentary mammary ducts give rise to the mammary tissue that will ultimately synthesis and secrete milk, these tissue precursors are important. In fact, calves with low or modest nutrient intake in the pre-weaning period produce significantly less milk later in life compared with those with a higher nutrition program. It is not unreasonable to view this enhanced pre-weaning feeding as a &#39;Head Start&#39; program for calves.Consequently, the first objective of our project is to learn the cellular and molecular factors that allow the improved mammary development in those calves better fed during the pre-weaning period. To address this objective we will randomly assign new born calves (n = 12) to a restricted (R) or enhanced (E) feeding regime. At weaning these animals will be sacrificed to provide tissues for analysis.We will measure the effects of these treatments on factors that correspond with mammary tissue growth. Measurements include: mammary tissue mass and composition [DNA, protein, lipid], mammary morphogenesis i.e. how the ductal elements actually develop [cellular stratification, development of myoepithelial cells], and quantitative multispectral imaging with immunocytochemistry. This last measure provides a way to measure the expression of proteins that we know impact development on a per cell basis. We will know what type of cells within the mammary gland is actually producing the protein and relatively how much. In the past most measures of protein expression required that the tissue sample be homogenized and expression compared relative to total tissue proteins. This imaging technique will give us very specific and novel information that relates protein expression to specific populations of defined cells in the developing mammary gland. Some of the proteins we will measure include estrogen and progesterone receptor, IGF-I receptor, incorporation of BrdU (relates to the rate of cell proliferation), and p63 (a marker of myoepithelial cells).A related hypothesis is that enhanced feeding alters myoepithelial cell development which modulates increased proliferation of epithelial cells and organization of mammary ductal structures. Our evaluation of myoepithelial cells in the bovine mammary gland is novel. Use of the p63 marker allows us determine the presence, location, and orientation of these cells in the developing tissue. In addition, mammary tissue collected will be cultured with graded concentrations of estradiol to measure acute gene expression responses to exposure to exogenous estrogen. This is a parallel to the experiment described below.A major hypothesis is that enhanced neonatal nutrition improves mammary development by increasing the responsiveness of mammary target cells to action of mammogenic hormones. We are focused on estrogen and signaling pathways known to have cross-talk with the estrogen receptor pathway, for example IGF-I. To test this hypothesis, calves (n = 24) will be assigned at birth to the two dietary treatments as described above. However, at weaning calves will be assigned to create the following treatment groups (n = 6/treatment): 1) calves fed R and given a placebo implant (R), 2) calves fed R and given an estradiol implant (R-E2), 3) calves fed E and given a placebo implant (E), and 4) calves fed E and given an estradiol implant (E-E2). Calves will be supplemented with estrogen for 2 weeks post-weaning, at which point all remaining animals will be harvested to assess the effects of estrogen within each diet on body and organ growth, particularly mammary gland growth. Measurements as described above will be applied to the tissues collected at sacrifice. In addition, collected tissue samples will be used to evaluate gene expression based on RNA sequence data. Combined with the appropriate bioinformatics analysis tools, this sequence data will provide a comprehensive evaluation of changes in expression of families of genes that regulate mammary growth and development and the impacts of diet and hormonal stimulation on expression of these genes.We expect the results of our project to provide important new information on the regulation of prepubertal bovine mammary development and to provide the impetus for nutritional and management tools to further improve &#39;Head Start&#39; programs for dairy replacement heifers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1007800,"Over 60% of all dairy cows develop fatty liver during the transition to lactation, resulting in a significant negative impact on milk production, cow health, and profitability. There is a critical need to identify metabolic or genetic factors that can predispose dairy cows to develop fatty liver. Our long-term goal is to understand the onset and progression of fatty liver disease and to develop targeted prevention strategies. Our central hypothesis is that adiponutrin regulates lipid metabolism in the liver and that decreased adiponutrin activity increases susceptibility to lipid accumulation. Our objectives are to 1) evaluate adiponutrin mRNA and protein expression in control and induced fatty liver transition cows; 2) determine regulation of adiponutrin mRNA and protein by fatty acids and elucidate the role of adiponutrin in triglyceride accumulation in primary hepatocytes using mRNA silencing; and 3) determine if mutations in the adiponutrin gene are linked to different hepatic lipid infiltration phenotypes. We expect that cows with fatty liver will have decreased adiponutrin expression during fatty liver onset and that on a larger scale, cows with greater liver lipids after calving will have mutations in adiponutrin that will decrease protein activity. We also anticipate that fatty acids will regulate adiponutrin expression and that when adiponutrin is knocked down chemically, there will be more lipid accumulation. Elucidating the regulation of adiponutrin will highlight potential interventions to improve liver efficiency and prevent fatty liver, and potentially provide a tool to identify cows predisposed to fatty liver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007803,"Studies are emerging showing that broccoli, known as an anti-cancer food, may also prevent inflammation. This is of significance since inflammation aggravates both the chronic diseases of aging and diseases of the colon, including cancer and colitis. Broccoli is a rich source of phytonutrients, including the glycosides of the flavonols quercetin and kaempferol, as well as glucosinolates, a group of sulfur compounds that are relatively unique to the brassica vegetables. Upon hydrolysis, glucosinolates release bioactive compounds including sulforaphane (SULFORAPHANE), which is thought to be responsible for many of the health benefits of broccoli. However, studies by us and others suggest that SULFORAPHANE is not readily absorbed from cooked broccoli due to poor deconjugation by the gut microbiota. This is of concern, since most people eat broccoli cooked and therefore may not gain the potential health benefits.Our long-term goal is to optimize the positive impact that whole broccoli has on total body health. The overall objective of this project is to determine the interaction between the gut microbiota and whole broccoli, focusing on gut health. Our central hypothesis is that frequent broccoli ingestion alters the gut microbiome, reduces gut inflammation, and improves the bioavailability and bioactivity of SULFORAPHANE. We have chosen to perform this basic research in rodents, giving the greatest flexibility to dietary manipulation and tissue sampling and evaluation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007807,"Feed is the greatest costfor beef producers. Improving the efficiency at which animals convert feed into energy for production of meat and milk, known as feed efficiency, is important to the sustainability of beef production. Feed is converted to energy by microbes in the rumen, and differences in these microbes across animals can explain why some animals are more efficient feed utilizers than others. Microbes become present in the rumen starting at birth, and we hypothesize that there are several factors that influence which microbes occupy the calf&#39;s rumen. Our aim is to determine how a calf&#39;s genetic background, mother, and birth environment affect the microbes that inhabit the rumen, and how those microbes relate to the calf&#39;s performance in later life. We expect to determine the degree to which each of these factors influences the calf&#39;s rumen microbes, and ultimately the calf&#39;s performance. This information will be used to determine how the rumen microbes may be altered to improve feed efficiency. For example, it may be possible to provide the mother with dietary supplements during later pregnancy or provide the calf with a dietary treatment shortly after birth toincrease favorable microbes in the calf. This project will generate novel information about the impact of microbes in the rumen on calf performance, and how those microbes may be influenced to improve feed efficiency of beef cattle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007844,"Outbreaks of agricultural and forest insect pests have significant economic and ecological impacts, but drivers of pest population dynamics, including the roles of climate and management, are often not well understood. Early reports on the effects of climate change warned of widespread increases in the frequency and severity of pest outbreaks, but these warnings have proven to be overgeneralizations. More recent studies have detected a wide range of pest responses to climate change, from outbreaks of unprecedented severity, to a recent cessation of outbreaksthat had occurred in consistent cyclesfor over 1100 years. Pest species are also subject to human interventions intended to limit their negative impacts, but knowledge of how management interventions, such as pesticide application, influence pest populations over the long term is limited. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the effects of climate and management on the outbreaks of agricultural and forest insect pests. Doing so is vital to adapting forest management and agricultural practices to the effects of climate change, and to predicting whether insects that are currently not important pests could become significant pests in future climates.The methodological approach of this project has several components. First, a database will be compiled that describes how the abundance of &gt;40 insect pest species, in multiple locations representing seven regions of the US, has changed through time. These data will be collected from published studies, public repositories, and groups such as state agricultural extensions. Analysis of the database will occur in four main steps. First, historical pest population patterns will be characterized, focusing on two questions. Overall, is the population increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? And, does the pest experience recurring outbreaks, and if so are they changing in their frequency or severity? Second, climate and management drivers of pest population dynamics will be evaluated. To improve insights into the underlying mechanisms that lead to changes in pest abundance, changes in abundance will be statistically decomposed into two factors that, respectively, represent the direct effects of environmental conditions, and effects that are mediated through interactions with other organisms, such as competition and predation. Then, relationships between each of these factors and variables representing climate and management effort will be quantified to investigate how climate and management affect the long-term population dynamics of insect pests. Third, the hypothesis that similar species respond similarly to climate change will be tested by statistically searching for characteristics of life history, ecology, and geography that are associated with a species&#39; response to climate change, for example whether its abundance is increasing or declining. If effective, this approach could be used to predict general responses of pest species for which little data is available, or to identify species that are not currently abundant but could emerge as significant pests in the future. The fourth and final step is to predict the potential future impact of these pests. Results from previous analytical steps will inform the development of models of how climate affects changes in pest abundance, which will be applied to projections from a suite of climate models to predict the frequency and severity of pest outbreaks between the present day and the year 2050.The ultimate goal of this project is to elucidate how climate variability, climate change, and management effort influence insect outbreaks. This question has significant socioeconomic implications given the negative impacts of insect pests on food production, forestry, outdoor recreation, and homeowner expenditures and property values. Improved understanding of underlying patterns and drivers of insect outbreaks, and their potential to change in future climates, is expected to inform adaptive strategies that limit these adverse impacts and improve the security and sustainability of agricultural and forest production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007846,"Native grasslands are being re-established on former row-crop fields for a diversity of purposes, including restoring biodiversity, conserving soil, and producing biomass. Each of these ecosystem services is likely to be maximized under different ecological conditions, but the outcomes of efforts to re-establish grasslands are variable. Further, the benefits associated with these grasslands are likely to change over time with shifts in ecological conditions. We have some understanding of the mechanisms that cause variation in re-established grasslands. However, we have very little understanding of the relative importance of these different mechanisms, and limited ability to predict how these communities will change over time.At grasslands re-established on former corn-soy fields in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, we will measure the availability of resources mostlikely to limit plant productivity, characterize soil microbial communities with environmental sequencing and morphological identification, and obtain land management records from site owners, including seed additions, invasive species removal, grazing history, fire frequency, time since grasslands were re-established, and weather conditions during the year a site was established. We will test these variables as predictors of the productivity and diversity of re-established plant communities and as predictors of variables important to soil conservation, including water aggregate stability and carbon sequestration. With this approach we will improve predictive ability of grassland restoration, identify the most effective management interventions, and indicate possibilities for novel approaches to grassland management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007851,"Overfeeding dairy cows prepartum causes the excessive accumulation of body fat. Consequently, overweight cows exhibit greater insulin resistance and fat breakdown resulting in an increased elevation of circulating nonesterified fatty acids that predispose them to postpartum metabolic disease. Because insulin resistant cows are more likely to develop a metabolic disease during early lactation, they are at greater risk for compromised milk yield and fertility. As a detriment, dairy producer profit margins are diminished and sustainability of the American dairy industry is challenged. Approaches to increase insulin sensitivity to reduce fat mobilization represent a new means to prevent metabolic disease in cows thus ensuring that our nation is best prepared for the growing food demand. Thus our goal is to define the mechanisms that mediate insulin resistance in dairy cattle. Overweight cows during late pregnancy exhibit elevated blood insulin, glucose, and fatty acids (i.e. overnutrition syndrome), similar to humans with metabolic syndrome; therefore, our hypotheses reflect mechanisms that mediate insulin resistance in humans and rodents. An initiating event is reduced fatty acid oxidation (i.e. breakdown) in liver cells. In turn, ceramide accumulates in liver tissue, which is subsequently packaged into lipoproteins that enter circulation. Ceramides are a type of fat molecule known to cause insulin resistance in rodent models. We hypothesize that liver-derived ceramides impair insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue. Decreasing the synthesis and accumulation of ceramide in overweight dairy cattle may be a means to restore insulin sensitivity and health. In a joint effort between West Virginia University and Johns Hopkins University, we will test our hypotheses by employing mass spectrometry-based lipidomics to profile ceramides in lipoproteins, plasma, and liver and adipose tissues before and after calving in lean and overweight dairy cows. We will also determine whether inhibition of ceramide synthesis can prevent insulin resistance in overweight dairy cows. Furthermore, we will also characterize whether ceramide can be used as a biomarker tomonitor dairy cow health, fertility, and milk production potential. Collectively, we anticipate that ceramide is the intermediary link between overnutrition and the development of insulin resistance in dairy cows transitioning from gestation to lactation. We expect to identify a means to improve insulin sensitivity and provide a new diagnostic approach to monitor the progression of metabolic disease in dairy cows. Understanding the mechanisms that mediate insulin resistance in overweight cows will enable us to devise practical strategies to prevent metabolic disease to support increased milk production and fertility.

1007856,"Wheat is one of the most important crops in the U.S., following corn and soy beans, with production exceeded by only China, the European Union, and India. Excess rainfalls near harvest can cause pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), rendering wheat unsuitable for human food use. This wheat can still be sold for livestock feed, but at staggering losses. Falling Number (FN) is a widely implemented method used to test enzyme activity of PHS-damaged wheat and determine pricing, but has not shown to be a reliable predictor. These discrepancies have highlighted a knowledge gap in how PHS influences starch properties within wheat kernels. The proposed FN system will be critical to addressing these issues as it will serve as the only means of communication between quality control and research. Our goals are to address critical issues related to wheat quality through (1) elucidating the mechanism for the effect of PHS, (2) clarifying the relationship between FN and end-use quality, and (3) facilitating the development of new wheat varieties that are more resistant to PHS. The acquisition of a FN system in this proposal will enhance research capacity at the University of Idaho (UI), the teaching quality of the food science and plant science programs, and the collaboration between food science and wheat breeding program at the UI. Through performing experiments, graduate students who are involved in the proposed project will receive laboratory instruction, and gain skills in performing experiment, critical thinking and problem solving. Through teaching starch chemistry course, students will learn specific knowledge of starch chemistry and apply the knowledge to solve related problems in food and agricultural industries. Students will be also more competitive in job markets after graduation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007858,"The long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel thermosonication processing technology to achieve an extended shelf life of 6-8 weeks for milk without an increase in HTST pasteurization conditions with the aim of maintaining product quality. In objective 1, we will acquire a fundamental knowledge of the interaction of temperature, time, and sonication on the destruction of thermophilic/thermoduric vegetative microbes and spores in milk. Microbial reduction at optimal as well as realistic processing conditions will be determined. These conditions will be verified in objective 2 using a bench scale thermosonication system (up to 1 L/min with 35 sec sonication residence time) to determine the influence of flow-through thermosonication on microbial reduction. Changes in physio-chemical milk properties (color, pH, viscosity, oxidized lipids, sulfur compounds) will be determined and milk will be analyzed for free fatty acids, hydrolyzed protein, and surviving microbes over an 8 week shelf life as quality indicators. We will then integrate a sonicator into our USDA-inspected dairy processing plant for verification of enhanced shelf life and quality of milk at pilot scale using a flow rate of 1.7 L/min (10.6 second sonication residence time) (Objective 3). Consumer sensory analysis on thermosonicated, pilot scale processed milk will be conducted over an 8 week shelf life to verify consumer acceptance and will be correlated to shelf life quality analysis.

1007866,"The U.S. is the largest beef producer, and beef industry is a critical segment in the U.S. agricultural economy. In 2013, the retail equivalent value of the U.S. beef industry was $88 billion and the total U.S. beef consumption was 12 billion kilograms. Customers rely heavily on the cherry-red color of fresh meat as an indicator of wholesomeness, and color of fresh beef is a major quality attribute influencing the purchase decisions at the point-of-sale. Fresh whole-muscle cuts discolor under retail conditions well before the microbial quality is compromised. Discolored beef cuts are often sold at discounted prices or ground to lower-value products such as ground beef, and if discoloration is extensive the products are discarded. All these retail practices lead to revenue loss, which is estimated to be more than $1 billion annually in the U.S. retail beef industry. Beef color stability is governed by the interactions between small biomolecules and myoglobin. Recent studies suggested possible relationships between phosphorylation of muscle proteins and meat quality. However, no investigations were undertaken to characterize phosphorylation in myoglobin and its impact on fresh meat color stability. Characterizing the biochemistry of phosphorylation in beef myoglobin will elucidate the impact of this post-translational modification on beef color stability. This also will aid developing novel processing strategies to minimize discoloration and to improve marketability of fresh beef.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1007872,"We propose sophisticated tools and strategies for evaluating the relationship between lipid particles in foods and the distribution and release of flavors, bioactives and other poorly water-soluble food ingredients that determine food quality. The new tools combine solid phase microextraction, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and dynamic tensiometry with quantitative tools of engineering analysis, to gain localized information on the concentration and transport of hydrophobic solutes within a lipid-containing food matrix. The tools will be developed and evaluated using mixtures of phospholipid and water, aggregated into various types of structured particles--materials found natively within foods or under development by food companies. The effect of the lipid structure on the partitioning of solutes between the lipid and water, and on the complex transport mechanisms for release of the solutes, can thereby be determined. We finally will apply our tools and insights to liquid mixtures that represent key aspects of flavor release from beverages in the mouth, and to foods exposed to the stomach or intestinal environment. Our goal is to gain localized, quantitative information on solute concentrations, over time and at equilibrium.

1007874,"Starch is an energy dense polymer of glucose that makes-up most of the dietary energy found in cereal grains (e.g., corn, sorghum, wheat). Small intestinal digestion of starch is very poor in cattle in comparison to many nonruminants (e.g., pigs, humans, mice), and almost one-third of the energy absorbed from small intestinal starch digestion contributes to omental (i.e., belly) fat accretion, which provides little benefit in production of beef or milk. Greater flow of high-quality protein (i.e., casein) or a specific amino acid (i.e., glutamic acid) can increase small intestinal starch digestion in cattle; however, little is known about how greater flows of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion or potential impacts on beef or milk production. We hypothesize that greater flows of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion by different mechanisms in cattle and that apparent influences on beef production will differ. This project will allow greater understanding of how increased absorption of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion by directly measuring pancreatic and small intestinal enzymes that can limit small intestinal starch digestion in cattle. Additionally, this project will provide insight to the potential value of increasing small intestinal starch digestion in cattle by greater postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid by measuring increases in dietary energy (i.e., retained energy) and quantify fates in the body from starch digested in the small intestine. It is likely that the mechanisms that increase small intestinal starch digestion in response to greater postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid differ and differences may have large impacts on dietary energy retained by cattle. Additionally, amounts of digested starch used for omental fat accretion may be less when small intestinal starch digestion is increased in response to greater small intestinal flows of casein or glutamic acid. Greater knowledge of how postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion in cattle and subsequent impacts on beef production may allow for broader application of diets that can increase efficiency of beef production in the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007883,"Agriculture accounts for 37% of all anthropogenic methane emissions with the single largest source coming from enteric rumen fermentation in ruminants. With global demands for meat and milk expected to double by 2050, lowering methane production in cattle is critical for sustainable agriculture in the future. At the heart of methane production in ruminants is a complex microbial community where microscale processes leading to methanogenesis are poorly understood. Despite limited knowledge of the rumen microbial ecosystem, attempts have been made to manipulate the abundance and activity of the rumen methanogenic microbial community with limited success. Understanding the rumen microbial community composition, function and microbial interactions would provide novel opportunities for methane mitigation. Consequently, the goal of this predoctoral research proposal by PD Christopher Anderson and Primary Mentor Dr. Samodha Fernando of University of Nebraska-Lincoln, is to understand the rumen methanogenic population through contemporary single cell genomics and function-centered community approaches. To this end, we will pursue the following objectives: 1) Examine the methanogenic, methanotrophic, and Thermoplasta species composition and associated metabolic processes in dairy cattle production systems; 2) Identify viral-methanogen interactions and their specific ecological patterns within the rumen methanogenic population. This study will develop an improved framework for understanding methanogenic processes at the microbial level in the rumen and create educational activities and opportunities for professional development.

To meet increasing groundwater demands, agricultural users are exploring the use of deeper saline water and desalination. However, critical gaps remain in knowledge of groundwater quantity, quality, and salinity across the state. Therefore, data-synthesis and modeling activities will be performed to answer the following questions, focusing on the Central Valley:1. What is the total volume and availability of groundwater with total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations of up to 10,000 ppm?2. What are the key trace contaminants found in deeper groundwater that may limit its use for irrigation?3. What are the salinity and key trace contaminant concentration profiles with depth throughout the basin? How much water is fresh or economically manageable/treatable for irrigation?4. What are the opportunities and challenges of using deeper groundwater resources and implications for meeting future irrigation demands?New datasets of groundwater quality and salinity including deeper groundwater resources will be assembled from diverse sources such as oil and gas databases. These databases will be used to map surfaces of TDS concentrations of up to 10,000 ppm, and concentrations of contaminants toxic to crops such as boron. Models of deeper aquifers identified to be a potential source of irrigation water will be developed to study groundwater availability.The ultimate goal of this project is to improve our understanding of deeper groundwater resources to safeguard groundwater today and for future generations. Societal benefits include increased sustainable food production and freshwater conservation. Groundwater quantity, quality, salinity, and irrigation issues are of concern in other states such as Texas and lessons learned from this project can be applied outside of California.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007891,"Birch syrup is an all-natural sweetener produced by concentrating sap collected from birch trees. The production of birch syrup can be a means for producers to increase the revenues and profitability of their farms and operations, while helping to meet growing consumer demand for natural, locally-produced food with excellent quality and flavor. However, there is currently no information, particularly science-based data from controlled experiments, available for birch syrup producers on the processing techniques necessary to consistently produce syrup with the best possible flavor and quality. This is particularly important for birch syrup production, as the composition of its sap renders it susceptible to the development of objectionable flavors, and small changes in processing conditions can result in significant reductions in the acceptability of syrup flavor.Thus, the overall goal of this project is to develop standard processing practices for producing pure birch syrup with optimal flavor and quality. This overall goal will be accomplished by first conducting controlled experiments with commercial equipment to determine the processing practices which consistently result in syrup with the most preferred flavor. Experiments will be conducted in which birch syrup is produced simultaneously from the same sap using different processing practices, and subsequent sensory evaluation experiments will be conducted to determine which technique produced birch syrup with the most preferred flavor. These data and results will then be used to generate standard practices required to consistently produce pure birch syrup with the best possible flavor and quality, and this information will be communicated to producers throughout the U.S. through online seminars, presentations, websites, and written technical articles. Producers will be able to use this knowledge and implement these processing practices to ensure that the birch syrup they produce will have the best possible flavor and quality, and thus the highest possible economic value. This will help make certain that consumers are consistently sold birch syrup with superior flavor and quality, and thus that demand for pure birch syrup continues to grow. Likewise, this will help to ensure that producers are able to achieve the highest possible revenues from birch syrup production. This will help producers increase the profitability of their farms and operations, and remain economically viable. This project will deliver producers science-based knowledge to help them make informed decisions about their processing practices that will help them increase the value of their birch syrup crop, thereby increasing profitability and ultimately helping to sustain their economic viability and enhance their quality of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007902,"Biological Freudianism, the lasting effects of early microbial or environmental influences, can profoundly impact the long-term health of the host. Little is known about how microbial colonization of neonates with specific microbes shapes mucosal homeostasis and overall health later in life; yet, the microbiota has a profound impact on multiple organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract and, therefore, likely impacts food animal production. The main objective of this proposal is to investigate basic mechanisms governing the neonatal-microbial relationship that influence intestinal homeostasis and host health. This will be investigated using a well characterized, reproducible gnotobiotic mouse model colonized with a simplified microbial community. Using this model, we will investigate how colonization with E. coli differentially affects mucosal homeostasis by comparing the outcome of colonizating neonates versus weanlings.Additionally, the impact of a probiotic Lactobacillus will be evaluated as a preventative intervention. Gnotobiotic mice will be colonized with E. coli +/- Lactobacillus, and colitis induced using dextran sodium sulfate. Markers of mucosal homeostasis, immunologic parameters, and microbial changes will be evaluated. The central hypothesis is that colonization of a pathobiont will differentially affect mucosal homeostasis and gut health depending on the age at colonization by reshaping the microbial community and inducing proinflammatory immune responses.

1007905,"Environmental stress, maternal diet, and fetal number are prevalent causes of fetal growth restriction in almost all production settings. In livestock, low birth weight significantly increases the risk for mortality and morbidity prior to weaning. Each year, the livestock industry loses 8-12% of its offspring to low birth weight caused by fetal growth restriction. Metabolic complications due to fetal growth restriction persist in animals that survive weannig, which slows growth and lowers meat quality, reducing producer revenue.As postnatal growth is largely dependent upon fetal growth and development, it is important to determine how management decisions could impact the growth trajectory of the fetus; however, it is not always feasible to prevent fetal growth restriction in production settings. Thus, our proposal focuses on identifying the mechanism that regulates skeletal muscle growth and metabolism that is altered by fetal stress due to fetal growth restriction. To test our hypothesis we will use a well-defined heat stress model of fetal growth restriction in sheep that shares the same physiological abnormalities as seen in other livestock species with this condition. This model has the advantage to allow us to control and quantify maternal, fetal, and neonatal conditions offering a tremendous opportunity to study muscle growth and metabolic adaptations and to test possible interventions for improvement. By confirming our hypothesis, we will define a novel mechanism that explains how fetal stress during growth restriction in utero is associated with postnatal metabolic dysfunction and growth deficiencies which are known to limit livestock production. This project will provide the foundation for potential interventions aimed at improving growth and metabolic outcomes in low birth weight offspring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in order for these technologies to reach their full commercial potential, they require polymeric packaging with a high oxygen and water vapor barrier. Thermal and pressure processes cause structural changes in polymers and increase their oxygen and water vapor transmission rates (OTR and WVTR), degrading the quality of processed foods during long-term storage and reducing their shelf-life to one year. This research aims to develop ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) and coated polyethylene terephlate (PET)-based new polymeric structures by exploring how MATS and HPP processes affect the structural and barrier properties of polymeric films. The study will also examine how OTR and WVTR of packaging films, light exposure and intial food conditions affect the shelf-life of processed foods. This research will accomplish three main goals:1. Design and fabricate new multilayer EVOH and coated-PET films with different microlayer thicknesses and additives, and evaluate the properties of these new materials after microwave, high-pressure and retort processing2. Develop kinetic models of food quality deterioration based on the oxygen and water vapor transmission rates of multilayer film, storage temperature, light exposure and initial food conditions, and3. Develop shelf-life prediction models and determine baseline oxygen and water vapor barrier properties of multilayer film-based pouches for three food categories to achieve desired shelf-lives.This research will benefit the polymer industry, food companies, military, NASA and consumers by improving the quality and shelf-life of packaged foods.

Understanding how to manage the agricultural sector in the face of climatic variability will enable the development of strategies aimed at coping with these challenges. This project proposes to analyze total factor productivity (TFP) in U.S. agriculture while utilizing an index that can explicitly isolate and account for climatic effects. In addition to evaluating the impact of climatic effects on TFP, this project will weigh the extent to which adaptation can be used to mitigate the effects of climate change and climatic variability by incorporating expenditures on research and development, as well as irrigation and ground water sources into the model.Another important negative aspect brought about by climatic variability in the United States is the specter of extensive drought that brings about water scarcity. Several regions in the United States continue to be challenged by widespread drought and water scarcity; hence, irrigation has become a major source of water supply. As a result, issues surrounding water conservation and water efficiency have been brought to the forefront.

1007912,"Animal pollination is required by 75% of crops and contributes $215B/year to world agriculture. Recent pollinator declines threaten crop yields and food security. Bumblebees and other wild pollinators contribute $3B/year to US food production, and may increase in importance as honeybee populations collapse. But parasites, including the globally distributed Crithidia bombi, have contributed to US bumblebee population decreases of up to 96%.Nectar consumed by bees contains antimicrobial phytochemicals that may be medicinal for parasitized pollinators, suggesting that floral resources could protect bees from infection. In our lab, 4 nectar phytochemicals reduced parasitism in C. bombi-infected bumblebees. Surprisingly, these putatively medicinal phytochemicals had different effects on 2 other C. bombi strains, implying that strains vary in phytochemical resistance and floral landscapes could select for resistance.Predicting the strength and duration of phytochemical effects on pollinator parasitism requires empirical tests of inter-strain differences and evolution of phytochemical resistance. This project will elucidate direct effects of phytochemicals on C. bombi cell cultures to determine:(1) Do strains vary in resistance to phytochemicals? Such variation may reflect or allow differential strain fitness in response to common floral chemotypes.(2) Can strains evolve resistance to phytochemicals? Chronic exposure could select for tolerant genotypes, thereby reducing the value of phytochemicals for pollinators.By training an entomology graduate student in insect parasitology and cell culture techniques, this Fellowship would facilitate additional research on pollinator diseases.

1007914,"Ticks are blood-feeding arthropods responsible for multiple vector-borne diseases in a wide range of domestic animals. The prevalence of ticks throughout the world makes them one of the most economically important ectoparasites of livestock. Current control methods include chemical acaricides; however, the emergence of resistant strains has reduced their efficacy. Efforts to maximize acaricide effectiveness are hindered by a paucity of information on the molecular and physiological mechanisms of acaricide resistance in ticks. Additionally, the efficacy of acaricides on ticks stressed by environmental conditions is an unexplored area. This study will identify underlying mechanisms of acaricide resistance in ticks by examining the physiological and molecular responses to pesticide exposure; additionally, the impact of environmental conditions on pesticide efficacy will be examined. The study systems will be the American dog and lone star ticks, species that parasitize many organisms, including livestock. Changes in gene expression in response to pesticide exposure and environmental stress will be examined using RNA-sequencing techniques. Additionally, fluctuations in metabolite levels will be measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Important genes and metabolites will be identified to elucidate mechanisms of acaricide resistance and to understand how changes in environmental conditions may influence acaricide efficacy. Results of this work have the potential to be integrated into existing tick control programs to maximize acaricide effectiveness and mitigate the development of acaricide resistance.

1007916,"Maintaining a reproductively-viable herd is vital to the prosperity and productivity of the beef industry. There are currently strategies to increase pregnancy rates, but many cows (8-13%) still exhibit signs of anovulatory infertility. Our lab has identified a subpopulation of cows (~10%) with endocrine and follicular profiles indicating sporadic anovulatory infertility (SPOV). These SPOV cows have high intrafollicular androstenedione (30-fold elevation) in the dominant follicle compared to ovulatory cows (OV) but lack a corresponding increase in estradiol. Microarray analyses comparing ovarian somatic cells from SPOV and OV cows identified pathways associated with inhibition of granulosa cell proliferation through decreased expression of cell cycle progression genes, increased expression of genes promoting granulosa cell death, and increased expression of viability genes in theca cells. Therefore, our hypothesis is that SPOV follicles experience theca cell androgen overproduction and inefficient granulosa cell estrogen production due in part to misregulation of cell proliferation and survival, ultimately creating a follicular microenvironment that prevents ovulation. We will test this hypothesis by: 1) Investigating if granulosa cells subjected to a high-androgen environment exhibit cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and perturbation of lipid metabolic pathways, thereby inhibiting the conversion of androgens to estrogens; and 2) Determining if a pharmacologically-induced high-androgen, low-estrogen environment reproduces the characteristics of bovine sporadic anovulation. The results of this research will provide a better understanding of the follicular microenvironment and its contribution to anovulatory phenotype and female infertility, allowing for enhanced fertility in beef cows or culling of reproductively inefficient females.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007920,"Rhizobia can reduce (fix) atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia in a symbiotic association with legumes. Because the limited amount of fixed nitrogen very often limits plant growth, these associations often occupy foundational positions in natural ecosystems and are very important in traditional forms of agriculture. Increasing the utility of nitrogen-fixing symbioses is one way of changing the current dependence of agriculture on industrial nitrogen fertilizers, a practice that generates a number of types of pollution, from soil acidity to atmospheric greenhouse gas generation and ozone destruction. Establishing an effective symbiosis requires the development of root nodules, unique symbiotic organs in which the specialized metabolism of nitrogen fixation, nitrogen assimilation and transport can take place. Both the plant and bacteria change during nodule development. Recent work has shown that members of the CspA family of bacterial RNA binding proteins are highly regulated during symbiotic development. The CspA family is named for the archetypal Cold Shock Proteins, but it is clear that the striking changes in CspA family gene expression during nodule development are not a response to cold stress and suggests instead that their induction/repression is a programmed way of controlling gene expression. In preliminary studies we have found that the set of RNAs that co-purified with different Sinorhizobium meliloti CspA homologs after heterologous expression in E. coli were distinct and were significantly enriched for regulatory RNA sequences containing base paired stem-loop structures. These data support a hypothesis in which riboregulation mediated by different CspA family proteins participates in symbiotic development through their interaction with specific stress or environmentally responsive RNAs. We will specifically address what RNA molecules CspA proteins modulate and how CspA function influences gene expression during symbiosis. Achievement of the proposed aims will begin to define mechanisms of CspA homolog function in rhizobia and expand the current understanding of gene regulation and stress response mechanisms in symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Application of this understanding is critical in ameliorating the financial and environmental cost of industrial nitrogen fertilizer use and is essential to meet future agricultural needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007922," The global spread of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms and spread of AMR-associated genes poses a serious threat to the safety of our food and public health while being responsible for increased hospitalization and mortality of both humans and production animals. The release of AMR genes and organisms, specifically antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and microbes, into the environment from agricultural sources is considered a serious threat, but little is known about their persistence and spread in the environment. Current risk assessment models cannot adequately characterize and quantify the proliferation of antibiotic resistance, especially in non-clinical settings. Reliable measurement and surveillance of antibiotic resistance is a complex problem that requires innovative solutions. This resesearch develops novel technology that will generate quantitative data on antibiotic-resistance genes in environmental samples. The advantages of this approach over existing technologies are that it does not require the cultivability of environmental bacteria; hundreds of resistance genes can be detected simultaneously; and hundreds of samples can be tested simultaneously. Applying this technology to environmental samples will determine points of maximum resistance gene diversity, thereby identifying the most efficacious mitigation points along the food chain. The development of this transformative approach that we are calling DARTE-QM (Diversity of Antibiotic Resistance genes and Transfer Elements-Quantitative Monitoring) integrates high throughput DNA sequencing technologies and an open-access data analysis pipeline that can identify the microrganisms in environmental samples that are contributing to antibiotic resistance gene prevalance.

While there are hundreds of peptide receptors present in the plant genomes, only a small number of peptides have been discovered so far. Research on small peptide hormones is largely limited by lack of a systematic approach for identifying them.

1007939,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a serious disease of livestock, especially cattle and sheep, which causes high morbidity and mortality as well as significant economic costs stemming from direct production losses as well as from international trade regulations. The virus is transmitted by biting midges in the genus, Culicoides. Although BTV was previously believed to be restricted to warm, tropical climates, it has expanded northward within the last decade, causing widespread and devastating outbreaks in Europe in 2006-2008. In the United States, BTV is absent from northern cattle producing states, where the primary North American vector, Culicoides sonorensis, is not found. However, there is concern that both vector and virus could spread north. To understand the risk of transmission, especially as northern temperatures become more suitable for tropical insects, many scientists have used mathematical models to calculate the potential range of vector species. However, these models only include data on the temperature tolerances of the adult stages.Because C. sonorensis spends most of its lifespan in one of three, relatively immobile immature stages (egg, larva, pupa), the environmental tolerances of these stages are more likely to determine the species&#39; range than those of the adults. In this study, we will define the limits of immature C. sonorensis survival at low temperatures by exposing them to subzero temperatures and calculating both their survival and the temperature at which they actually freeze. We will quantify the amount of glycerol, a cryoprotect chemical produced by many insects at low temperatures, produced by each immatures stage. Taking all this data together will help us understand which stage is primarily involved in overwintering. Additionally, we will also compare how low temperaturelimits and glycerol production differ between subtropical C. sonorensis populations (from southern California) and from populations near the known northeastern limit of the species (from the front range of Colorado), which may have different overwintering strategies suited to their climates. Ultimately, this data can be used to develop more accurate species range and expansion models. These models allow scientists to predict where and under what circumstances, BTV may appear in the future. Policy makers and animal health officials can then use this information to prepare livestock producers in these areas for the potential of transmission by initiating vaccination and vector control efforts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The implications of being infected with Salmonella strains producing thistoxin, both with regards to the severity of infection and the long-term effects of potential DNA damage incurred during an infection, have not been examined. This investigation will (i) determine the prevalence of the toxin among Salmonella strains associated withhuman clinical salmonellosisin the US, and (ii) determine the potential implications of both the short- and long-term outcomes of infection with Salmonella strains producing the toxin.This research will advance our understanding of the role of the toxin in Salmonella infections, and will aid in future considerations of toxin-positive strains as potential food adulterants. In addition, this project will serve to train (i) the next generation of food safety experts through hands-on research and mentoring student projects, and (ii) consumers and food processors through food safety outreach activities. On a broader scale, this project will advance food safety through both research and community outreach avenues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1007947,"The goal of this proposal is to enhance plant nutrition by developing a technology that uses soil protists to increase effectiveness plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Sometimes PGPR work reliably, and cost effectively. Often, however, PGPR are ineffective because they do not reach their sites of action on plant roots. This can be caused by: restricted movement of PGPR through soil; inefficient water-based transport of PGPR or competition with endogenous soil bacteria.We propose that soil protists have the capacity to move PGPR and that they could increase PGPR effectiveness by allowing PGPR to keep up with growing roots. We will isolate from Medicago truncatulaand soybean rhizospheres 30 types of cyst-forming protists. These will be characterized in an in vitro micromodel to select those that best transport bacteria to legume roots. In vitro data will be used to derive agent-based models of protist transport. The top 8 PGPR-moving protists will be used in a series of increasingly realistic experiments to determine their effectiveness in moving rhizobial bacteria. Experiments will measure the effects of protists on: rhizobial transport through soil, rhizobial effectiveness with competitors and rhizobial effectiveness on established roots.Rhizobia, the most frequently used PGPR for nutrient acquisition, are inoculated on soybean, alfalfa, bean, pea, clover and other legumes to provide cheap and sustainable nitrogen. Their use could increase if inoculation was more effective. Nitrogen acquisition in nonlegumes, phosphate acquisition, iron acquisition and biocontrol are also facilitated by PGPR and may be enhanced by protist transport of PGPR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007949,"Plants incorporate atmospheric carbon dioxide into sugars, a process that ultimately sustains all life on Earth. In agriculture, CO2fixation is a longstanding target for improvement, because doing so could increase yield and reduce environmental impacts of farming through reduced water and fertilizer consumption. This project is based on novel lines of maize that were created, that have a more than 50% increase in the amount of theoretical CO2fixation capacity. These lines were found to have a marked resilience to chilling stress, because in maize chilling stress has a strong negative effect on photosynthesis. Thus, these modifications appear to improve maize tolerance to an important climaticstress. Theproposed work focuses on chilling stress, comparing performance of different maize lines under several chilling regimes at the seedling or grain-filling stages. Plants will be characterized at a molecular level, and whole plant performance will be assessed for photosynthetic parameters, biomass and grain yield. The lines will also be tested in response to water or heat stress, which is often encountered in the field. Together, the results may offer an avenue for improving crop performance under both stress and non-stress conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007952,"Modern industrialized agriculture is sustained by heavy application of inorganic nitrogen (N)-based fertilizer. In this practice, up to 60% of N fertilizer can be lost through transformation to other nitrogen compounds and leaching into groundwater, and through greenhouse gas emissions. These effects can reduce crop yields, pollute groundwater, and increase global warming. For example, in 2011, the EPA estimated that fertilizer application accounted for 69% of total US nitrous oxide greenhouse gas emissions. The loss of N fertilizer, production of greenhouse gas, and the efficiency of inorganic-nitrogen uptake by plants are all influenced by the process of nitrification. Nitrification is carried out primarily by two diverse groups of soil microorganisms: the ammonia oxidizers (bacteria and archaea) that transform ammonia to the more toxic nitrite, and the nitrite oxidizers (bacteria) that transform nitrite to plant-preferred nitrate. Inefficient coupling of nitrification can lead to toxic effects caused by accumulated nitrite, including nitrous oxide greenhouse gas production, while complete nitrification leads to leaching of accumulated nitrate into groundwater. The mechanism of establishing and maintaining coupling of nitrification in soils, especially between diverse soil microorganisms, is poorly understood. A possible mechanism to establish and maintain coupling among these microorganisms is cell-cell signaling, termed quorum sensing (QS) in bacteria.Acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) chemical signaling in bacteria is the most well studied form of QS, but this phenomenon is under-studied in nitrifying bacteria. QS has only been briefly studied in two ammonia oxidizers, and our group only recently identified acyl-HSL production in a nitrite oxidizer. I hypothesize one mechanism of establishing and maintaining nitrification coupling is that ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers communicate by acyl-HSL QS and this modifies their transcriptomes and physiology. I plan to investigate this phenomenon using the model nitrifying bacteria Nitrosomonas europaea (an ammonia oxidizer) and Nitrobacter winogradskyi (a nitrite oxidizer), two nitrifying bacteria that produce similar chemical signals. I will confirm the identity of chemical signals (acyl-HSLs) used by these microorganisms to communicate and use a novel lactonase enzyme that prevents QS by depleting chemical signals to investigate the effects of QS during pure and co-culture of these nitrifying bacteria. Next-generation sequencing technology (mRNA-seq) will be used to identify the purpose of QS in these organisms and determine if it plays a role in nitrification. Finally, the project will determine how common QS is in nitrifying bacteria by screening other diverse nitrifying bacteria for acyl-HSL production in collaboration with other investigors in the field. The data obtained from these studies will be disseminated to the scientific community via scholarly publications and communicated to the general public via guest lectures in college and high school classes, as well as through outreach via public science lectures (OMSI science pub) and/or college radio interview programing (KBVR Inspiration Dissemination). Understanding QS in nitrifying bacteria could allow future scientists to control the flow of nitrogen in agricultural systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007954,"Forestlands provide critical ecosystem services (e.g., water quality protection) that enhance environmental quality and support growing populations. Forest lands also contribute to the economic viability of agriculture. In Florida alone, they contribute over $12bn/year in economic outputs and support over 90,000 jobs. These lands are increasingly under pressure from threats including land use change, climate variability, and invasive species. Addressing these problems is a major US policy goal; yet we know relatively little about the public&#39;s preferences for processes used to implement environmental policies/programs. My recent work (e.g., my dissertation research) revealed public preferences are in fact linked with program processes, which is important for designing environmental policies that reduce tradeoffs and enhance synergies between the agricultural economy and environmental benefits such clean water resources.The project has two phases used to assess the social acceptability and economic effectiveness of using payments for ecosystem services (PES) incentive programs to stem the loss of forestland, protect ecosystem services and increase financial sustainability of agricultural operations. In phase one I will use a generalized Faustmann model for loblolly pine stands to simulate the impacts of employing Best Management Practices (BMPs) for water resource protection on the net present value of forest outputs (e.g., timber) for eight representative sites in four heavily-forested southeastern states (FL, GA, SC, MS). Model results will identify tradeoffs in financial impacts and production of ecosystem services and timber. These results will inform phase two, the development of a stated preference valuation survey of the public in these states to identify levels of social support for alternative environmental programs given the tradeoffs in forest outputs and other important attributes: land protection method (e.g., permanent easements), institutional involvement (e.g., public), and cost. The valuation survey will employ a relatively novel stated preference valuation approach (best-worst choice) and econometric methods. Methodologically, this project is unique for its integration of forest stand-level modeling and stated preference valuation techniques.Results will fill critical knowledge gaps on public preferences for landowner incentive programs that can be used to inform economic tradeoffs associated with policies that sustain agricultural communities while protecting important ecosystem services. Importantly, the integrated project also includes the development of Extension products to inform key stakeholders about the tradeoffs inherent in alternative approaches to protecting forestland. The proposed project directly addresses the mission of AFRI and the four-part goal outlined by the National Research Council Committee: to satisfy the agricultural needs of humans, enhance environmental quality, sustain the economic viability of agriculture and enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole. Together with the mentoring and training dimensions of the project (see Project Narrative), the proposed project also meets the AFRI-ELI program goal of helping prepare the next generation of scientists because it will move my research in a direction that would set me apart in my field, give me skills to build an independent research program in forest economics and policy and preparethe Post-DoctoralAssociatefor a tenure-track university faculty position.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007964,"Worldwide, arsenic frequently contaminates rice, presenting a risk to food safety. Additions of silicon have shown promise in reducing uptake of arsenite, but reducing uptake of organic arsenic is less studied. Uptake of organic arsenic compounds may also cause straight-head disease in rice, thereby lowering yields. The overall goal of this research is to develop agronomic techniques for reducing rice uptake of organic arsenic compounds, particularly monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Towards this goal, the project will investigate the following three factors&#39; ability to limit rice uptake of organic arsenic: silicon amendments, organic acid amendments, and nitrogen source. Amendments successful in reducing uptake of DMA and MMA in hydroponic studies will be tested in field trials to improve the nation&#39;s food safety via reduced risk to consumers. This project also includes several career development and mentorship aspects, including the co-development of a plant-contaminant interactions course, mentorship of students, attending career development workshops, and learning of new analytical skills.

1007965,"Skim milk powder (SMP) is an inexpensive protein ingredient, but its application in beverages is limited due to turbidity caused by the micellar structure of caseins and the tendency to aggregate and precipitate at acidic pH. The overall project goal is to improve physical properties and applications of SMP by reducing the size of casein micelles and preventing their precipitation at acidic pH. Our preliminary work indicated that derivatized SMP (dSMP) can be produced by heating SMP dispersion at around pH 3.0, and the dSMP enabled clarity at pH 3.0-7.0, with assistance of soluble soybean polysaccharides at intermediate acidity. Three objectives are proposed to advance and understand the application of dSMP in beverages. The first objective is proposed to understand the mechanism of producing dSMP and characterize physicochemical properties of dSMP. This will be studied for physical properties of SMP before and after derivatization, primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structural changes of proteins, and molecular forces involved in these changes. Polysaccharides will be studied to disperse dSMP at pH 2-7, and protein-polysaccharide interactions will be characterized. In the second objective, functional properties of dSMP will be studied in model beverages that will be characterized for quality parameter changes during shelf-life storage. In the third objective, sensory properties and consumer acceptance of model beverages prepared from dSMP will be characterized and will be correlated to functional properties to be studied in the second objective.

1007974,"Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy that affects 1% of the world population, characterized by adverse reactions to gluten upon consumption, resulting in inflammation and permanent damage to the small intestine. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate ways in which commonly consumed dietary polyphenols found in plant-based foods can attenuate CD-related intestinal permeability and inflammation by interacting with gliadin, the immunostimulatory subunit of gluten. The first objective is to elucidate the mechanism of interaction between gliadin and a series of phenolic compounds and determine the physical characteristics of the complexes formed. The second objective will investigate the effects of gliadin-polyphenol complex (GPC) formation on the stimulation intestinal permeability and inflammation using an in vitro model of the small intestine lining and immune cells. I hypothesize that gliadin will form complexes with phenolic compounds which will modify protein structure, reducing or eliminating the potential for gliadin to stimulate the intestinal damage associated with CD. Alternative therapies for the treatment and prevention of symptoms associated with Celiac disease have been explored extensively, though their availability for general use is limited. The potential development of a supportive treatment of Celiac disease with naturally derived, dietary compounds (e.g., phenolics) would provide a safe and accessible alternative for the prevention or alleviation of symptoms of the associated autoimmune response.

Single kernel near infrared (NIR) sorting system and genomic selection may complement each other in the breeding scheme to improve genetic gain for milling and nutritional quality. The objectives of this seed grant proposal are to: 1) develop genomic selection models for key oat milling and nutritional quality traits, and 2) develop a single kernel NIR calibration to sort grain based on beta-glucan concentration.A set of approximately 450 advanced oat lines will be grown at four locations over two years.

In addition, a single kernel NIR calibration will be developed for beta-glucan concentration. Segregating populations will be sorted using the newly developed calibration. The high beta-glucan sorted sample will be grown along with the unsorted sample to determine if the increase in beta-glucan in the high beta-glucan sort is due to genetic differences.The proposed research is expected to lead to the development of an efficient selection strategy that will use single kernel NIR sorting system and prediction of genotype from phenotype to increase the rate of improvement for grain quality.

1007979,"Trichothecenes areubiquitoustoxic secondary metabolites produced by pathogenic fungi in host plants such as wheat, barley, oats, and maize. Due to their natural occurrence in food and high toxicity, trichothecene contamination of food and livestock feed (&gt;78% toxin present) poses a great threat to food safety and human, animal, and planthealth.However, there is a critical gap in our knowledge about the way the toxin works in living cells leading to toxicity that endangersanimals and humans. Previous studies identified novel mechanisms for trichothecene-induced cell death involving themitochondria, an important component of thecell that functions to help produce energy. These studies have shown that the toxin-induced cell death involved mitochondria and genes involved in lipid metabolisms which mediated sensitivity to these toxins. Therefore, the proposed project will study the role oflipid signaling as a mitochondrial &#39;surveillance&#39; mechanism induced in response to trichothecene-mediated stress.Applying high-throughput methods in molecular biology and biochemistry, this research will identify lipids altered in response to toxin treatment and determine if lipid signaling is important for trichothecene-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation. It will also measure therecognition and degradation of trichothecene-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, a selective degradation of damaged mitochondria. The research will identify critical components of the mitochondrial-nuclear signaling pathways using yeast (highly conserved between yeasts and animal cells) and then investigate them in more detail in animal cells. This research will leadto new insights into how these toxins modulate themitochondria and mitochondrial signaling and advance our understanding of mechanisms whereby environmental toxins derail the fate of mitochondria in the affected animals. The knowledge gained here will aid efforts to mitigate the impacts of trichothecene contamination in food and food safety; facilitating the development of safer practice and standards in human and animal consumption of contaminated products.Ultimately, the project will aid in promoting safer food, developing potential applications for animal health improvement, and reducing economic losses due to trichothecene contamination.

1007984,"Arid and semi-arid woodlands provide essential ecosystem services and are a critical component of rangeland landscapes. Trees in these woodland ecosystems occur near their functional limits with respect to water availability and may be strongly affected by climate change. Previous modelling studies quantifying how changing climate may affect semi-arid tree population dynamics have been limited by a lack of empirical data on the effects of climate variability on tree reproductive outputs, particularly among mast seeding species (i.e. species with highly synchronous and intermittent production of large seed crops). The research component of this proposed project examines how climate variability influences seed production dynamics of singleleaf pinyon pine, a dominant and widespread mast-seeding conifer of the Great Basin. This project also assesses the sensitivity of pinyon pine populations to changes in the magnitude and timing of seed production under different climate change scenarios. Understanding the resilience of pinyon pine populations to changing climate is important due to the multiple ecosystem services and ecological benefits this species provides. Regeneration failure of this foundation species would impact wildlife populations that depend upon woodland habitat and pinyon seeds as a food source, and would dramatically alter water and energy fluxes and carbon stocks. The highly nutritious pine seeds are also gathered by commercial and non-commercial pine nut harvesters, including Native American tribes, for both economic and cultural purposes. The education component of this proposed project will increase the science literacy of high school science students by training science teachers on innovative teaching methodologies and developing instructional materials. Development of a case study teaching module will be based on research results and used to educate students about plant reproduction and the potential impacts of climate change.

1007985,"The ProblemAbout one-third of the U.S. dairy herd valued at ($5.4B) is replaced yearly. These replacement animals come from the female calves born to lactating cows on these farms. It has become widely appreciated that nutrition and management of animals in early life can dramatically affect future performance, longevity, and well-being of these animals. We recently confirmed that pre-weaning calf nutrition can dramatically affect growth and development of the mammary gland and especially the quantity of epithelial tissue in the developing gland. Because these rudimentary mammary ducts give rise to the mammary tissue that will ultimately synthesis and secrete milk, these tissue precursors are important. In fact, calves with low or modest nutrient intake in the pre-weaning period produce significantly less milk later in life compared with those with a higher nutrition program. It is not unreasonable to view this enhanced pre-weaning feeding as a &#39;Head Start&#39; program for calves.Consequently, the first objective of our project is to learn the cellular and molecular factors that allow the improved mammary development in those calves better fed during the pre-weaning period. To address this objective we will randomly assign new born calves (n = 12) to a restricted (R) or enhanced (E) feeding regime. At weaning these animals will be sacrificed to provide tissues for analysis.We will measure the effects of these treatments on factors that correspond with mammary tissue growth. Measurements include: mammary tissue mass and composition [DNA, protein, lipid], mammary morphogenesis i.e. how the ductal elements actually develop [cellular stratification, development of myoepithelial cells], and quantitative multispectral imaging with immunocytochemistry. This last measure provides a way to measure the expression of proteins that we know impact development on a per cell basis. We will know what type of cells within the mammary gland is actually producing the protein and relatively how much. In the past most measures of protein expression required that the tissue sample be homogenized and expression compared relative to total tissue proteins. This imaging technique will give us very specific and novel information that relates protein expression to specific populations of defined cells in the developing mammary gland. Some of the proteins we will measure include estrogen and progesterone receptor, IGF-I receptor, incorporation of BrdU (relates to the rate of cell proliferation), and p63 (a marker of myoepithelial cells).A related hypothesis is that enhanced feeding alters myoepithelial cell development which modulates increased proliferation of epithelial cells and organization of mammary ductal structures. Our evaluation of myoepithelial cells in the bovine mammary gland is novel. Use of the p63 marker allows us determine the presence, location, and orientation of these cells in the developing tissue. In addition, mammary tissue collected will be cultured with graded concentrations of estradiol to measure acute gene expression responses to exposure to exogenous estrogen. This is a parallel to the experiment described below.A major hypothesis is that enhanced neonatal nutrition improves mammary development by increasing the responsiveness of mammary target cells to action of mammogenic hormones. We are focused on estrogen and signaling pathways known to have cross-talk with the estrogen receptor pathway, for example IGF-I. To test this hypothesis, calves (n = 24) will be assigned at birth to the two dietary treatments as described above. However, at weaning calves will be assigned to create the following treatment groups (n = 6/treatment): 1) calves fed R and given a placebo implant (R), 2) calves fed R and given an estradiol implant (R-E2), 3) calves fed E and given a placebo implant (E), and 4) calves fed E and given an estradiol implant (E-E2). Calves will be supplemented with estrogen for 2 weeks post-weaning, at which point all remaining animals will be harvested to assess the effects of estrogen within each diet on body and organ growth, particularly mammary gland growth. Measurements as described above will be applied to the tissues collected at sacrifice. In addition, collected tissue samples will be used to evaluate gene expression based on RNA sequence data. Combined with the appropriate bioinformatics analysis tools, this sequence data will provide a comprehensive evaluation of changes in expression of families of genes that regulate mammary growth and development and the impacts of diet and hormonal stimulation on expression of these genes.We expect the results of our project to provide important new information on the regulation of prepubertal bovine mammary development and to provide the impetus for nutritional and management tools to further improve &#39;Head Start&#39; programs for dairy replacement heifers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1007989,"With increasing demand for local and sustainably-produced food, growers have adopted farming techniques to extend the growing season in temperate regions, such as transitioning production into high tunnels. These structures create unique growing environments that present new challenges to insect pest and disease management. Thus, developing sustainable, low-input and organic methods for growers is a critical knowledge gap that is increasingly important on diversified farms.One of the most pressing problems in cucurbit production, both in high tunnel and open-field, is damage caused by cucumber beetles and the bacterial pathogen, Erwinia tracheiphila, transmitted by this beetle complex. Many organic growers throughout the U.S. rate this as the most devastating and difficult to manage pest. Extending the cucurbit growing season in high tunnels increases the importance of understanding secondary vectors and inoculum on the landscape, as the crop is susceptible for much longer periods compared to open-field production. However, virtually nothing is known about the beetle complex--consisting of at least four species differing widely in their phenology and behavior--including their role in the epidemiology of disease progression in high tunnels and how these vectors can be sustainably managed.Here I propose to fill in critical knowledge gaps on E. tracheiphila infection by monitoring beetle population dynamics and bacterial inoculum throughout the growing season to identify susceptible time points during production. In addition, I will examine the efficacy of two novel management strategies for high tunnel organic cucurbit production: fine mesh screening and grafting. These techniques will be evaluated to control cucumber beetles and bacterial infection, while taking into account corresponding effects on secondary pest outbreaks (e.g., aphids and mites) and changes in the growth environment (e.g., elevated temperature). The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals, extension publications, and demonstrated to growers via field days and farm tours at Purdue&#39;s research facility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007990,"Wheat is a major food crop in the US. Wheat production has been continually threatened by various biotic and abiotic stresses. There is a constant need to find and deploy new genes in wheat to strengthen its defense against new threats. However, wheat has limited genetic variability due tothe nature oforigin, which has increasingly become a bottleneck for wheat improvement. It is essential to bring new genes into wheat to expand its genetic variability. The wild grass relatives of wheat represent an invaluable gene pool for wheat improvement. Favorable genes of wild grass relatives can be incorporated into wheat by ph1b mutant-induced homoeologous meiotic recombination. However, the ph1b mutant, originally developed in the old Chinese wheat landrace &#39;Chinese Spring&#39; (CS) with poor agronomic characteristics, has not been deployed in most classes of US wheats. Here we propose to deploy the ph1b system in the US wheat and build an effective pipeline of gene flow from wild grasses into US wheats. The specific objectives of this project are to: 1) Incorporate CS ph1b mutant into US wheats for homoeologous recombination-based geneintrogression (HRBGI);and 2) Develop ph1b mutant-specific molecular markers to improve the efficacy of the mutant inHRBGI.Ultimately, this research will enable US wheats for HRBGI and create an operative entrance of alien genes into US wheats for germplasm and variety development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007992,"Predoctoral Research Project SummaryMatthew D.H. Boyer (PD), PhD candidate in Organismic &amp; Evolutionary Biology and Entomology, Biology Dept. University of Massachusetts AmherstDr. Lynn S. Adler (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor, Biology Dept., University of Massachusetts AmherstFoundational program areas addressed: Agricultural systems and technology - This project investigates a potential biocontrol agent Plant health and production and plant products - This project investigates insect vectors of a major plant pathogen in highbush blueberry.Challenge areas addressed: Food safety - This project investigates a potential biocontrol agent to control mummyberry disease in highbush blueberry.Understanding the insect vectors, transmission efficiency, and fungal competitors of mummyberry disease (Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi) in highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum)Plant diseases are common in agricultural systems and are major sources of loss for crops domestically and around the world. Mummyberry (Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi), is the most threatening pathogen to highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) crops, with infections reducing crop yield up to 80% and causing major economic losses. In addition to distribution via wind and rain, pollinators and other insects vector the disease. Infected flowers develop inedible berries that drop, overwinter, and produce spores that begin a new cycle of infection.Resistance varies greatly within highbush blueberry cultivar, but the mechanisms of resistance are unclear, providing an area of research with great potential to improve yield. V. corymbosum is highly dependent on pollination services, and because pollinator species can vary in the efficiency of vectoring both pollen and fungal spores, it is important to assess whether cultivars differ in the abundance or composition of pollinator visits, and whether visitation differences correspond to likelihood of becoming infected. This is key to understanding the role of pollinator communities in cultivar resistance to mummyberry.Pollinators also differ in their pollen transfer efficiency. Mummyberry spores mimic pollen grains in the mode of delivery, therefore pollinators may also differ in their effectiveness as disease vectors. This proposal aims to identify differences in pollen/conidia transfer efficiency between pollinator taxa.Pilot study in this system has revealed a competing fungus present in some blueberry flowers that inhibits mummyberry growth in vitro. The last objective in this proposal seeks to assess mechanisms of competition between mummy-berry and Irpex lacteus, a potential biocontrol agent.

1007994,"Symbiotic associations with bacteria are ubiquitous across animals. In insects, these associations might be exploited to serve as an alternative and safe method of pest control. One such association, with the bacterium Wolbachia, is promising due to its ability to spread in a population and modify insect reproduction. These interactions are being exploited to both: 1) control pesty insects through manipulating population sizes, and 2) increase population sizes and effectiveness of beneficial insects by creating more females. Unfortunately little is known about the mechanisms and evolutionary history of this system. Currently, attempts to establish a Wolbachia infection in a new insect have proven difficult. The most successful transfers have been into mosquitoes, where ongoing trials showing that release of these new, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes can prevent disease transmission, and keep mosquito populations at bay. This is a promising new approach to pest control -- the hope is to use Wolbachia to knock down populations of agricultural pests and the pathogens that they transmit, as well.The commonly used biological control agents, Trichogramma wasps, provide an experimentally ideal and agriculturally relevant system with which to study host-adaptation in Wolbachia. Objectives of the proposed project are: 1) Identify Wolbachia genes under selection pressure during host-adaptation using a novel experimental evolution system, and, 2) Identify Wolbachia genes evolving rapidly across Trichogramma, allowing for host-specificity. In the first objective, a genome re-sequencing approach will be used to track mutations that occur when Wolbachia is challenged with a new Trichogramma host. The second objective will employ the comparative genomics of Wolbachia strains across Trichogramma to look for evolutionary signatures of adaptation. Findings can be applied to improving and informing the transfer of Wolbachia to pesty insects, and improving the efficiency of Trichogramma in biological control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007995,"Climate change and species introductions can result in dramatic phenotypic shifts in economically and ecologically important species. This project will (1) determine the underlying behavior and disease ecology of a damaging novel life-history phenotype in an invasive yellowjacket wasp, and (2) assess this species&#39; potential for vectoring pollinator pathogens in Hawaii and California. Vespula pensylvanica is of particular agricultural significance because it preys on, robs honey from, competes with, and likely shares pathogens with honeybees and native pollinators. A multi-queen, perennial colony phenotype is currently common only in introduced populations in Hawaii, where it has tremendous ecological impact and poses a threat to pollinator populations. Through field experiments and chemical analyses, we will determine how behavioral and chemical changes have led to this shift in social organization, allowing us to better predict when social insects will undergo similar transitions following future climate or range shifts. We will determine pathogen overlap with honeybees to assess this species&#39; potential to function as a pathogen vector or reservoir in apiculturally important regions. Finally, we will use field experiments, lab assays and molecular genetics to test the hypothesis that the transition to perenniality is influenced by wasp self- medication via honey robbing from feral honeybees, with implications for managing this novel perennial phenotype. These results will inform the maintenance of pollinator services in the face of global change, with implications for plant and animal production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1007999,"Post-harvest spoilage of fresh produce is a critical challenge. Despite advances in hurdle technologies, over 30% of the fresh produce in North America is wasted, largely due to microbial spoilage that results from- limitations of the current washing and sanitation procedures in achieving a significant inactivation of spoilage microorganisms, cross-contamination, and adaptability of microflora to grow under refrigerated and modified storage conditions. To address these challenges, this proposal evaluates two distinct ultrasound (US) based sonochemical approaches. The aim 1 will focus on a synergistic interaction of low-frequency (&lt;50 kHz) US with sonocatalytic coating on food-contact surfaces to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. We hypothesize that food-grade sonocatalytic materials such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide will generate sufficient ROS (reactive oxygen species) upon exposure to US to efficiently inactivate spoilage microbes on these surfaces, thus reducing the risk of biofilm formation and cross-contamination. The aim 2 will focus on microbubbles assisted high-frequency (1-10 MHz) US process to inactivate spoilage microorganisms on fresh produce and wash water while maintaining the produce quality. We hypothesize that controlled cavitation from exposure of food-grade microbubbles to high-frequency US (1- 10 MHz) will trigger ROS generation from food-grade sonocatalytic compounds in wash water. Together, they will effectively inactivate microorganisms while minimizing the mechanical damage to fresh produce commonly associated with conventional low-frequency US (~ 50 kHz) . These hypotheses are supported from literature and preliminary work. In aim 3, we will evaluate extension of shelf-life of produce by proposed approaches and perform preliminary cost-benefit analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1008000,"Global population is expected to reach 9.5 billion by the year 2050 and along the same timescale, shortages in land and water for food production are expected. Ruminant livestock (cows, sheep, goats)are an important part of the food production system because they have the unique ability to convert human inedible fiber (plants) into high quality, human edible protein (meat, milk). Unfortunately, ruminants are particularly affected by changes in climate and thus projected climate change is a notable barrier to improving livestock sustainability. Heat stress, in particular, already accounts for $1.7 billion in losses in the livestock sector annually. As the climate warms, this economic and productive burden will increase. To improve efficiency of heat stressed animals, we must better understand how feed is digested and how nutrients are absorbed (and subsequently made available to the animal for use as energy or protein-building blocks). The goal of this project is to identify how digestion of feed and absorption of nutrients are changed when animals are heat stressed. Ruminant animals have a complex microbial ecosystem dwelling in their digestive system and this microbial population is responsible for digesting feed. To understand how outside temperature affects digestion in ruminant animals, we will identify key species of microbe responsible for unique roles (digesting fiber, digesting sugar etc.) and monitor how their populations shift after an animal is exposed to heat stress. Additionally, we will add labeled molecules into the rumen (digestive chamber) that will allow us to track the production and absorption of the end-products of the digestive process. We believe that shifts in blood flow occur to help the animal maintain body temperature and these shifts in blood flow likely affect how effectively nutrients are absorbed. Blood flow to the digestive system will be monitored by infusing labeled molecules into the rumen and evaluating how those labeled molecules disappear over time. We will also measure the abundance of proteins responsible for transporting digested nutrients across the rumen wall into the blood stresm. By collecting information about shifts in microbial populations in the digestive system and resulting changes in nutrient digestion rates, we can better understand how temperature stress affects digestion of feed. By collecting information about how digestive end products are removed from the rumen and how blood flow and nutrient transporters are changing, we willdevelop an improved understanding of how heat stress affects absorption of nutrients. The overall goal of this projectis to generate knowledge that can be applied to help improve feed efficiency (conversion of human inedible feed into human edible food) of ruminant livestock exposed to hot environments. A notable portion of ruminant animals in the U.S. are exposed to several months of thermal stress and the productivity losses associated with this stress are substantial. By better understanding how the animal digests and absorbs food when it is stressed, new feeding strategies can be tailored to help ensure stressed animals recieve sufficient nutrition. Feeding stressed animals more precisely will help to ensure that sufficient high quality, human edible protein is available for the growing global population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1008001,"Conversion of renewable biomass to the next generation of fuels and chemicals is one promising strategy for energy independence. In one approach, biomass can be deconstructed to sugars, which are then fermented by microorganisms to produce the biofuel. However, the amount of biofuel at the end of the fermentation is often too low for industrial purposes. I hypothesize that individual enzymes responsible for converting the sugar to biofuel have poor kinetic properties, and that this limits the amount of biofuel that can be produced. I have developed a new method to efficiently test tens of thousands of enzymes to find the few that have improved kinetics. The ultimate goal of this project is to use my method to improve the production of the important biofuel isobutanol from sugar. If successful, will demonstrate this powerful approach to increase the amounts of other biofuels used for diesel and jetfuel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
